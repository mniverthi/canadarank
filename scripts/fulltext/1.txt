Prime minister says Canada will ‘stand up loudly’ for human rights after China’s ambassador against welcoming Hong Kong pro-democracy activists

Justin Trudeau hits back at China after threat to Canadians in Hong Kong

Canada will continue to defend human rights in China, prime minister Justin Trudeau has pledged, after a top Chinese diplomat warned Ottawa against welcoming Hong Kong pro-democracy activists.

China’s ambassador to Ottawa, Cong Peiwu, warned Canada on Thursday against granting asylum to Hong Kong activists, which he said could have consequences for the “health and security” for the 300,000 Canadians living in the theoretically autonomous Chinese territory.

The Canadian daily The Globe and Mail said Ottawa had recently granted asylum to a Hong Kong couple, which the Canadian government has neither confirmed nor denied.

“We will stand up loudly and clearly for human rights, all around the world, whether it’s talking about the situation faced by the Uighurs, whether it’s talking about the very concerning situation in Hong Kong, whether it’s calling out China for its coercive diplomacy,” said Trudeau on Friday when asked about the Chinese ambassador’s comments.

But he added: “We don’t look to escalate.”

In a sign of the rising tensions between the two countries, Canadian foreign minister Francois-Philippe Champagne had earlier slammed the ambassador’s remarks as “totally unacceptable and disturbing”.

For his part, the new leader of the conservative opposition, Erin O’Toole, called on the Chinese diplomat “to fully retract his remarks and issue a public apology”.

“Should the Ambassador fail to do so expeditiously, we expect the government to withdraw his credentials,” he said.

Relations between China and Canada have been icy since December 2018 when Canada, acting on a US warrant, arrested the chief financial officer of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei.

Washington accused her of violating US sanctions against Iran and is pushing for her extradition.

Shortly after her arrest, China jailed a former Canadian diplomat, Michael Kovrig, and a Canadian businessman, Michael Spavor, on charges of spying, an act widely seen in western capitals as an act of reprisal by Beijing. Pallister PCs Launch RFP to Privatize Manitoba Parks

October 15, 2020

TREATY 1 TERRITORY, WINNIPEG, MB - Manitoba Liberals are condemning the Pallister PCs' decision, along with Travel Manitoba, to issue a request for proposal on how to privatize and sell off Manitoba's parks.

The RFP was posted to MERX on October 13 by Travel Manitoba, entitled "For the Provision of Evaluating Manitoba's Provincial Parks." The RFP acknowledges that the province's parks infrastructure hasn't seen improvements for 40 or 50 years.

Manitoba Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont and MLA for St. Boniface, said the PCs should be investing in infrastructure renewal for parks for Manitoba 150. Instead, the Pallister Government is going to break them up, sell them off, and encourage private operators to gouge Manitobans to raise revenue.

"Public parks belong to all of us. We all own and pay for them through our taxes, and we should be making sure everyone can access them, not just a privileged few," said Lamont. "This is not about improving parks. It is about a broad conservative strategy of transferring commonly owned, public property into private hands for private profit."

The RFP calls for all 76 parks to be evaluated, and requires the contractor to determine:

What assets should be divested?

Identify partnership and P3 investment opportunities with the private sector, municipalities and First Nations to improve park infrastructure/services or decommission/transition parks to other models (i.e. other groups operate or own parks to service their local community).

The RFP also asks to provide recommendations and next steps for:

A new business model for Manitoba Provincial Parks that increases visitor spending, revenues and cost recovery.

Investment and divestment requirements for existing infrastructure assets.

Lamont said the PCs policies are regressive.

"Some things should not be for sale. Public parks should stay public," said Lamont.

This is simply opacity for its own sake

Veteran Canadian journalist Michael Petrou told an amazing tale on Twitter on Thursday with respect to his investigation into aid Canada provided to Libyan rebels way back in 2011. At the time, he appealed one of the redactions in documents he had received through an access-to-information request. This week, seven years later, his appeal was upheld … and the foreign affairs department refused to nix the redaction anyway.

The information in question wouldn’t have caused Harper’s government any grief in 2011, let alone Trudeau’s in 2020. This is simply opacity for its own sake.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Non-journalist Canadians are often incredulous when you tell them how much more forthcoming American officialdom is with harmless information, but it’s night and day. Communications officers in the U.S. government generally exist to communicate with the public, not to intermediate between grown-adult journalists and grown-adult civil servants and politicians who are perfectly capable of calling each other’s telephones. We could do that too, if we wanted. But governments don’t want it, and nobody cares, so it doesn’t happen.

Electoral reform remains Trudeau’s signature broken promise, if only because he broke it so flamboyantly, so insultingly, and at such great expense. But at least he felt the need to humour the proportional representation fans who fell for his grift, setting up a committee and pretending to be interested in its findings. His promise to fix access-to-information procedures and timelines, his “open by default” pledge, didn’t even get that. It got chucked behind a sofa and forgotten.

Flying this blind, Canadians are relying enormously on their politicians’ honour, good intentions and backbone to stay on the straight and narrow. They should tune into the ethics or finance committee some day soon and ask themselves if that’s wise.
