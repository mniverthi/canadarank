In the wake of attacks against a First Nation’s fishery in southeastern Nova Scotia, questions are being raised about a lack of RCMP enforcement — which many say might have nipped the conflict in the bud.

On Thursday, Sipekne’katik Chief Mike Sack sent a message to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, asking him to send more law enforcement to the area to quell the conflict and counter actions he has described as hate crimes.

“This truly is systemic racism,” Sack said. “Does Trudeau care about our people? Does he care about reconciliation? They talk about it, but I don’t see any actions toward it.”

Two days earlier, about 200 men descended at different times on a pair of lobster-storage sites being used by the Sipekne’katik First Nation for the moderate livelihood lobster fishery it has undertaken.

The fishery has been launched in the face of opposition from non-Indigenous fishers and long-unresolved negotiations with the federal government over what constitutes a “moderate livelihood.”

At the first site, in New Edinburgh, police reported seeing a van set afire, and people throwing rocks and causing damage to the building and vehicles. At the second, in nearby Middle West Pubnico, the mob trapped a Sipekne’katik fisher inside, hurling rocks and racial taunts until the man was forced to leave without the lobster he’d caught that day. RCMP reportedly advised the fisherman he would have to leave.

No charges have been laid in the incidents.

The actions follow reports of Indigenous lobster lines being cut, traps being pulled up and, in one case, a fishing boat set ablaze when the Sipekne’katik launched its fishery weeks earlier.

No charges have been laid in those instances, either.

The Sipekne’katik chief said he’s been forestalling calls to bring in Indigenous warriors from across the country to take up enforcement in a situation where he believes both the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the RCMP have been lacking.

“My belief is that everything could have been a lot safer if the DFO acted in the first place, and some of those commercial fishermen were held accountable and charged for their actions,” he said.

“(They’re) believing that they can do whatever they want, and get away with it and take the law into their own hands. And I’m starting to believe that’s true.”

He said the band is in the process of pursuing lawsuits against those who are interfering with its fishery.

RCMP Sgt. Andrew Joyce, meanwhile, said the immediate priority for the police force in the dispute has been to prevent loss of life.

“As a police force, we come to an incident and we’re severely outnumbered. You have 200 or so individuals who have high emotion to an issue, and are confronting another, smaller group of individuals. Our main goal here is the protection of life,” he said.

“We’re trying to make sure nobody is grievously hurt, or worse. We recognize that during this incident, that that there was criminal behaviour. It was being videoed. We understand all that.”

But Joyce said, under those circumstances each arrest would have taken two officers away from a situation in which they were already outnumbered. He also said that the fact that no charges have been laid as yet does not preclude charges for those incidents being laid in the future.

“There are there are some out there who feel that the police response was inadequate. (That) we didn’t do a good job. That’s their right to say that, and I respect them for saying that,” he said.

“A lot of those emotions come from either interactions or frustration over this specific issue of where it is going. And I can’t say this enough. This issue, I’m no expert on. But I do know it is not a police issue. I think we’ll all agree to that.”

The Sipekne’katik cite a Supreme Court of Canada decision in 1999 that acknowledge their treaty right to fish for a modest livelihood. Non-Indigenous fishermen argue that they are opposed to the band’s decision to start a commercial lobster fishing business that is operating outside the federally regulated lobster season.

Colin Sproul, head of the Bay of Fundy Inshore Fishermen’s Association, said he condemns the violence but added it is the product of years of growing concern about the state of the stocks.

“We’re Canadians. We should expect that dialogue is always the way to solve our problems, not through violence,” he said.

He also criticized the Mounties for failing to take action against any of the parties to the dispute. He said he was dumbfounded a few weeks ago when he saw Indigenous fishers trying to board a non-Indigenous boat in St. Mary’s Bay while an RCMP tactical squad observed.

“I can accept that Indigenous people may have seen acts of violence perpetrated against them that the RCMP walked away from, too,” he said.

In Ottawa, Minister of Indigenous Services Marc Miller said he found the images of Tuesday night’s violence alarming.

“We’re talking about a fundamental right to earn a moderate livelihood, that is a right the Mi’kmaq are entitled to exercise,” Miller said. He noted that “moderate livelihood” has never been defined in a way that’s acceptable to all sides and said non-Indigenous fishers need be involved in the discussion.

“The risk, if we don’t get this right, is that people will die. ... Violence begets violence, and that is unacceptable,” he said.

Following a cabinet meeting Thursday, Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said he was “extremely disappointed” by the federal response to date around the Indigenous lobster fishery. McNeil said Ottawa needs to find a workable solution by sitting down with all sides in the dispute as soon as possible.

“This is only getting more entrenched ... they need to be in the same room so everyone knows what each other is saying,” he said.

McNeil also said the province would provide police with the “resources necessary,” including manpower to ensure public safety in the area. “If more people are required, we obviously would have to pick up that bill,” he said.

Provincial Justice Minister Mark Furey said he was satisfied with the RCMP response, adding that he thought it’s been a “measured approach” under difficult circumstances.

Sack said during the news conference the Mi’kmaq fishery will continue despite the damage done to the holding facilities, the burning of one fisherman’s boat and damage to vehicles in recent weeks.

He said the band is now in the process of purchasing the damaged plant in New Edinburgh, which he said would include a buyer’s licence if the sale is completed. “It’s just a matter of doing the paperwork,” he said.

His Liberal government will likely roll out aspects of its longer-term agenda in a budget update by Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland next month, according to a person familiar with the plans.

The document will mainly focus on updating projections and explaining how the run-up in deficits will be financed, the person said, speaking on condition they not be identified. But the government is also considering funding for some of the initiatives outlined when parliament resumed last month. Big-ticket priorities in the mix include daycare, pharmacare, the environment, housing and transit.

Trudeau has been hinting he wants to keep the fiscal taps open, and the government’s role in the post-pandemic recovery will be the central political debate through the new year. The main opposition Conservatives are already threatening to drag the Bank of Canada into the melee.

“The prime minister laid out that they’re going to do whatever it takes and I think Canadians would generally agree with that approach,” said Elliot Hughes, a former adviser to Freeland’s predecessor, Bill Morneau. “Right now Canadians are supportive, but it’ll be interesting to see where we’re at in five or six months.”

Public opinion polling reflects the risks ahead for Trudeau -- who lacks a parliamentary majority and requires the support of at least one other party to stay in power.

According to a survey by Nanos Research for Bloomberg News earlier this month, almost 60% of respondents say they are at least “somewhat comfortable” with Trudeau’s pledge to continue “supporting people and businesses through this crisis as long as it lasts, whatever it takes.” About 40% were either uncomfortable or somewhat uncomfortable.

But stronger divisions emerge over the direction of fiscal policy post-Covid. A separate Nanos poll published by the Globe and Mail newspaper this week found just over one third of Canadians back borrowing to invest in “social and economic priorities” beyond pandemic needs. Nearly 60% said the government should show restraint or only borrow for pandemic purposes.

The opposition is also trying to straddle the difference between the two types of spending. In contrast to the U.S. where lawmakers have been unable to agree on new stimulus measures, the Conservatives supported legislation last month to beef up programs for unemployed Canadians. But they voted against Trudeau’s so-called Throne Speech, effectively a rebuke of his expansionist long-term vision.

“We believe that permanent new government programs would be a disaster for the country,” Pierre Poilievre, chief Conservative spokesman on finance issues, said in an interview. “Once the pandemic ends, we will need to gradually phase out the deficit -- not permanently lock it into place.”

Canada’s government has already budgeted just under C$400 billion ($303 billion) in response to the pandemic. Adding provincial shortfalls, the International Monetary Fund projects deficits this year will reach around 20% of gross domestic product, the highest in the Group of 20. The parliamentary spending watchdog, meanwhile, predicts a gap of nearly C$74 billion next year without taking into account any new measures.

In an illustration of how heated the debate is becoming, Poilievre said the independent central bank can expect a higher level of scrutiny if it uses its bond-buying power to help Trudeau’s government finance deficits for non-emergency reasons.

The issue even prompted a shake-up of the Liberal front bench this summer. Morneau was forced out in August when friction between his office and Trudeau’s burst into public view.

Corporate leaders are also raising concern, particularly after Canada was stripped of its AAA status by Fitch Ratings Inc. in June.

“We’ve frankly overstimulated the economy for what was necessary,” Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said by phone. “Take notice of the fact that credit rating agencies are watching.”
