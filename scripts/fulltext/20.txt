U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at the Port of Buffalo seized more than a tonne of cannabis in a commercial shipment this week coming in from Canada.

This is the most recent in a string of large seizures since the border was closed to all but essential traffic in the wake of the global pandemic.

On October 15, CBP officers discovered 2,145 vacuum-sealed one pound packages of cannabis in a commercial shipment of 20 pallets during the internal inspection. It was also determined that the marijuana had an estimated street value of more than $8 million dollars, at a value of about $5 a gram.

US border authorities now say they have captured more than 40,000 pounds of cannabis coming in from Canada since last October, valued at nearly $100 million US.

Both US and Canadian authorities have intercepted numerous large cannabis shipments at or destined for the US border since the two countries closed their border to all non essential traffic in March due to the global pandemic. The bulk of seized shipments has been since the border closure in March.

“Our CBP officers remain enforcement focused and driven and this latest large load marijuana seizure is proof of that”, said Port Director Jennifer De La O. “Their efforts have produced record setting results for narcotics seizures within the Buffalo Field Office exemplifying their dedication to the CBP mission.” Send this page to someone via email

Montreal doctors say the Quebec government is still ignoring their concerns about the shortage of family physicians in the city.

The comment follows the health ministry’s revelation that it’ll issue 98 family doctor permits for 2021, about the same as this year. Family physicians like Jhanzaib Sherwani believe it means certain populations will continue to be underserved. He said he’s been trying to get a permit to practice as a family doctor in Parc-Extension for two years.

“Traditionally this has been an area which has lacked access to primary care,” he told Global News from a clinic he opened in the area.

Sherwani has a permit, known by the French acronym, PREM (plans régionaux d’effectifs médicaux) to practice in Ahuntsic-Montreal North jurisdiction.

PREMs are issued annually by region, meaning he cannot practice in Parc-Ex, which comes under the Côte-des-Neiges-Metro-Parc-Extension region. Under the rules, he has to spend most of his time in the area which his permit covers — 55 per cent of his time, minimum. It means his Parc-Ex clinic is open for just two days a week.

His wife Meera Kotecha, who recently completed her studies in medicine, also wants a permit to work in Parc-Ex, where the need is great.

“I have goals to work with marginalized populations and work with women, in particular, to advocate for them,” she explained.

According to Sherwani, one reason the Parc-Extension neighbourhood is underserved is that it falls in the same region as Côte-des-Neiges and a part of downtown Montreal where there are large hospitals and teaching institutions.

“Traditionally people who get the PREMs in this area tend to work at those institutions,” he pointed out.

That leaves communities like Parc-Ex without enough family doctors, he argued, made worse because the area is densely populated, with many people considered lower-income.

“The number of PREMs that are allocated doesn’t represent the needs of the population of this area,” he noted.

Other general practitioners like Henry Coopersmith say they’ve been pressing the government to change the process of issuing of PREMs for years.

“Because it’s a management solution,” he insisted from his office in Westmount. “It’s not just money.”

Coopersmith says the current system leaves too many gaps, especially in Montreal because of its population, leaving people to have to wait years to get a family doctor.

“Which makes no sense,” he fumed. “It absolutely makes no sense.”

He warns that the problem will likely get worse because a large number of doctors are about to retire, including himself, in a few years.

“I will have to be replaced by two and a half physicians, but the PREM will only give one physician place to take over my 3,800 patients,” he said, pointing out that most doctors take about 1,000 patients.

“So I’m going to have 2,800 patients who are not going to have a physician,” he said.

Quebec Health Minister Christian Dubé said Wednesday that his government is trying to find ways to make it easier for Quebecers to find a doctor.

“We’re working on the quantum, having more generalists,” he said. “But we’re also working on making sure that Quebecers can call a doctor and have an answer within 36 hours, even though they are not allocated to one.”

Sherwani said because Parc-Extension has to compete with big hospitals for physicians, he has been pushing to have the area become its own jurisdiction. For 2021, 10 permits have been allocated to the region, but three of the positions have already been reserved. He and Kotecha say they hope they each get one of the balance to be able to work in their Parc-Ex clinic.Send this page to someone via email

A breakdown of applications for the simplified EI program shows that overall there had been more than 1.5 million claims as of late this past week, among them 1.15 million people who were automatically transferred when their emergency benefit ran out.

The figures are enormous for a system that in one day this month handled 246,000-plus claims. In the spring, officials worried the 87,000 applications on one March day would make the decades-old system burst its seams.

Figures obtained by The Canadian Press also show that more than 84 per cent of applications had been processed, which experts who reviewed the numbers noted was a positive sign for the transition off the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, better known as the CERB.

Couple that with the more than 300,000 people who turned to a suite of new benefits on the first day they were available, and the figures provide a hint at the ongoing need for income support even as employment has picked up.

Figures on claims can be “valuable in providing a partial, real-time assessment” of the impact COVID-19 has on the labour force, officials wrote to Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough in April.

At the time, they were writing in a briefing note about providing regular updates on CERB recipients and payments as “the labour market landscape continues to evolve across the country.”

The Canadian Press obtained a copy of the briefing note under the Access to Information Act.

The CERB ceased to exist on Oct. 3, although people can still retroactively apply for CERB payments until Dec. 2. The government expected up to four million people would use the revamped EI and three additional benefits for those not EI-eligible.

Up to 2.8 million people would need EI, based on internal projections from the department that oversees the program. About one million more would likely need the three new benefits.

On the first day it was available this past week, 240,640 people applied for the Canada Recovery Benefit. By that same Monday, a further 107,150 applied for a caregiving benefit and 58,560 applied for the new two-week sickness benefit, both of which had opened for applications the previous week.

The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives had estimated about 5,000 people would use the taxable sickness benefit. Its senior economist David Macdonald said the vastly higher number suggests some EI-eligible workers may have found it easier to apply for the sickness benefit.

“There will be plenty of honest confusion among people as to where they might apply next, and they might take the path of least resistance, which is going to be these (recovery) programs,” said Macdonald, who has closely tracked aid figures.

Mikal Skuterud, a professor and labour economist at the University of Waterloo, said there may also be people who are EI-eligible but apply for the CRB because of other differences in the programs, such as how quickly benefits are clawed back, how long they last, and how much tax is taken off at the source of payments.

“There are some big issues there, but that’s kind of unfair to criticize the government because designing these kinds of income-support programs for self-employed people is a quagmire,” he said.

The first EI payments went out this week, with just over 84 per cent of applicants receiving benefits, a figure experts noted as positive.

The labour market has recouped about 2.3 million of the three million jobs lost when the pandemic first struck. A new round of restrictions amid rising COVID-19 case counts threatens some of those gains.

Given the unknown future path of COVID-19, Scotiabank senior economist Marc Desormeaux said the government will have to be very careful about when it winds down the pandemic benefits.

Ending programs too soon could lead to weak business results as fewer people have money to spend, leading to potential bankruptcies or closures, creating job losses and making employment weak anew.

“We want to try and recover more quickly to the extent that we can, because these things have a way of reinforcing themselves,” he said in an interview.

“At this point, we’re comfortable with these (benefits) being in place, just to provide that certainty and a cushion against potential second-wave impacts.”
