Two years after Canada legalized recreational cannabis, the country is awash with the stuff.

Hundreds of thousands of kilograms of cannabis sit idle in producers' vaults. Warehouses operated by provincial wholesalers are filled to the brim with finished products. Meanwhile, illicit growers remain active and add to a country-wide stockpile that is far outpacing market demand.

The mountain of pot is expected to balloon further once producers – both legal and illicit – finish their "Croptober" harvest, the term used within the cannabis industry in reference to the period around October when outdoor cannabis crops are chopped down and processed.

"There has been too much cultivation in Canada," said Rahul Sarugaser, managing director of equity research at Raymond James, in a phone interview. "But that is secondary to the fact that there have been too many players and as a result, there's too much competition in the market."

There are 507 producers that Health Canada has licensed to grow cannabis legally, with roughly 60 of them selling into the recreational market. That's created a market where there are 45 million packaged cannabis products held by cultivators, processors, distributors, and retailers across the country, roughly four-and-a-half times the amount being sold in June, according to recent Health Canada figures.

That supply imbalance is causing major headaches for the industry.

More than a dozen cannabis companies have filed for creditor protection and major producers like Canopy Growth Corp. and Aurora Cannabis Inc. have written down billions of dollars in inventory and assets. Meanwhile, industry woes accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to hundreds of layoffs. Even the eagerly-anticipated "Cannabis 2.0" rollout of vapes and edible products was met with early delays and launch stumbles.

Sarugaser expects the supply glut to ease in the coming years as companies that aren't able to produce cannabis in an economically viable manner fade away.

"There are big names that maintain the largest market share that produce negative gross margins quarter-over-quarter. That's simply not a way to run a business," he said.

There have been some notable successes, however, with spending in the legal recreational and medical cannabis market now eclipsing the illicit market, according to recent figures from Statistics Canada. Total sales have risen steadily each month and the Canadian market is currently forecasted to produce annual sales of about $2.8 billion.

Retail is also turning a corner after a myriad of stumbles in the first year, notably in Ontario. The country's most populous province now counts 200 stores open and is adding 40 new shops a month, while there are more than 1,200 licensed pot shops available nationwide.

Even the illicit market has found itself in the crosshairs of nationwide police investigations that seized hundreds of thousands of cannabis plants over the past year, including a recent bust in August where $42 million worth of illegally-grown pot was captured in Ontario’s Niagara region.

Combating the illicit market has not been an easy task, but some producers are going toe-to-toe with their unregulated counterparts, growing cannabis for less than $1 per gram while others have turned to the great outdoors to produce it for pennies. More than 1,200 acres of land is being used to grow outdoor cannabis this year, more than twice as much as last year, according to Health Canada.

"How else do you beat the black market? You do what they do," Geoff Benic, chief executive officer of Aleafia Health Inc., told BNN Bloomberg as he stood in the middle of the company's property outside of Toronto where 50,000 cannabis plants would soon be harvested.

"You play their game, just with more sophistication."

To prepare for their harvest, Aleafia’s staff was busy earlier this month strategizing over PowerPoint presentations while other workers put the finishing touches on a 35,000-square-foot dry room complete with a customized ventilation system that would soon host some of the company's crop.

Benic allayed concerns that the company was only adding to the existing glut of cannabis in the market, noting that a good chunk of the plants grown at Aleafia's facility contain high levels of cannabidiol (CBD), the non-impairing chemical compound used to treat pain and inflammation. It's part of a bet he made that Canada would soon deregulate CBD for over-the-counter products and eventually allow exports to foreign markets. When that day comes, the company will have plenty of products to meet demand.

"I truly believe that CBD will be no different than what Omega-3 is to eggs," Benic said.

John Fowler, principal of consultancy Blaise Ventures and founder of Supreme Cannabis Co., argues that companies shouldn't be blamed for growing too much cannabis. Instead, he said producers didn't do enough research to understand what products consumers wanted in the first place.

"There are companies out there that have inventory that they can't sell, that they're producing, and are actively buying other inventory that they sell, which means there's a mismatch between their production and what their customers want to buy," he said.

While production doesn't appear to be slowing down, next year should bring some optimism to the beleaguered sector

Raymond James' Sarugaser expects growth to continue in the space, propelled by ongoing cannabis store openings and more familiarity with new products that should hit the market.

"We're starting to see a loosening up of the markets," he said. "We're seeing an opening up of retail, we're seeing the value segment drive top line revenue for the good operators, and then we should see the eventual adoption of Cannabis 2.0 products into 2021."​ The employment insurance system absorbed almost 1.3 million people in the last three weeks, new figures show, as a key COVID-19 benefit wound down.

A breakdown of applications for the simplified EI program shows that overall there had been more than 1.5 million claims as of late this past week, among them 1.15 million people who were automatically transferred when their emergency benefit ran out.

The figures are enormous for a system that in one day this month handled 246,000-plus claims. In the spring, officials worried the 87,000 applications on one March day would make the decades-old system burst its seams.

Figures obtained by The Canadian Press also show that more than 84 per cent of applications had been processed, which experts who reviewed the numbers noted was a positive sign for the transition off the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, better known as the CERB.

Couple that with the more than 300,000 people who turned to a suite of new benefits on the first day they were available, and the figures provide a hint at the ongoing need for income support even as employment has picked up.

At the time, they were writing in a briefing note about providing regular updates on CERB recipients and payments as “the labour market landscape continues to evolve across the country.”

The Canadian Press obtained a copy of the briefing note under the Access to Information Act.

The CERB ceased to exist on Oct. 3, although people can still retroactively apply for CERB payments until Dec. 2. The government expected up to four million people would use the revamped EI and three additional benefits for those not EI-eligible.

Up to 2.8 million people would need EI, based on internal projections from the department that oversees the program. About one million more would likely need the three new benefits.

On the first day it was available this past week, 240,640 people applied for the Canada Recovery Benefit. By that same Monday, a further 107,150 applied for a caregiving benefit and 58,560 applied for the new two-week sickness benefit, both of which had opened for applications the previous week.

The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives had estimated about 5,000 people would use the taxable sickness benefit. Its senior economist David Macdonald said the vastly higher number suggests some EI-eligible workers may have found it easier to apply for the sickness benefit.

“There will be plenty of honest confusion among people as to where they might apply next, and they might take the path of least resistance, which is going to be these (recovery) programs,” said Macdonald, who has closely tracked aid figures.

Mikal Skuterud, a professor and labour economist at the University of Waterloo, said there may also be people who are EI-eligible but apply for the CRB because of other differences in the programs, such as how quickly benefits are clawed back, how long they last, and how much tax is taken off at the source of payments.

“There are some big issues there, but that’s kind of unfair to criticize the government because designing these kinds of income-support programs for self-employed people is a quagmire,” he said.

The first EI payments went out this week, with just over 84 per cent of applicants receiving benefits, a figure experts noted as positive.

The labour market has recouped about 2.3 million of the three million jobs lost when the pandemic first struck. A new round of restrictions amid rising COVID-19 case counts threatens some of those gains.

Given the unknown future path of COVID-19, Scotiabank senior economist Marc Desormeaux said the government will have to be very careful about when it winds down the pandemic benefits.

Ending programs too soon could lead to weak business results as fewer people have money to spend, leading to potential bankruptcies or closures, creating job losses and making employment weak anew.

“We want to try and recover more quickly to the extent that we can, because these things have a way of reinforcing themselves,” he said in an interview.

Editor’s Note: The lobster pound in this story was originally described as a Mi’kmaw owned lobster pound. That is incorrect. Global News has removed that reference.

An enormous fire completely destroyed a lobster pound being used by Mi’kmaw fishermen in Middle West Pubnico, N.S., early Saturday morning.

Jonathan LeBlanc, a member of the Eel Brook Fire Department, told Global News that several local fire departments were called to the scene around midnight. It took over four hours to contain the fire, with crews later turning to a cleanup mode.

Reached overnight, Nova Scotia RCMP said they were unaware of the incident. Yarmouth County RCMP said in a statement Saturday morning that the fire is considered “suspicious” and an investigation is ongoing.

The plant was not occupied at the time and none of the employees were injured, RCMP said. According to police, however, one man is in hospital with life-threatening injuries that are believed to be related to the fire.

The lobster pound is the same one that was swarmed, vandalized and ransacked by a large crowd of non-Indigenous commercial fishers and their supporters Tuesday night.

Mi’kmaw fisherman Jason Marr told Global News he and others were forced to take cover inside the lobster pound as the building’s windows were smashed out and Marr’s vehicle was damaged, he said.

“They vandalized (my van) and they were peeing on it, pouring things into the fuel tank, cutting electrical wires,” Marr said on Wednesday. He also claimed they smashed the windows of the van, and said he saw them kicking, punching and hitting it with objects.

Video taken on Tuesday night and posted on Facebook shows a damaged vehicle at the scene.

Marr alleges the non-Indigenous fishers threatened to “burn” his group out of the building if they didn’t leave and allow them to seize the lobster catch.

“I thought they were gonna kill me,” the Mi’kmaw fisherman said.

A similar incident happened at another lobster pound in New Edinburgh, N.S., earlier Tuesday, where the crowd removed and damaged video cameras then ransacked the lobster pound and storage facility where the lobster catch was to be housed.

Sipekne’katik First Nation Chief Mike Sack released a statement Saturday saying that the fire “illustrates the need for greater police presence in the region… I do believe with the proper police presence, however, this could have been avoided.”

“I am once again calling on Prime Minister Trudeau and the RCMP to dedicate the necessary resources to this region to protect everyone. I am extremely concerned that someone is going to hurt or worse,” Sack added.

According to Sack, the facility is owned by “a friend and ally of Sipeknek’katik, where one of our community members was barricaded and his catch destroyed last week.”

“This should never have happened and the people responsible should be brought to justice.” Tweet This

Sack said he hopes to try and find some balance with the commercial fishery, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the province and the RCMP.

“I say this with the utmost respect, we have been calling for dialogue and recognition of our rights for years and we appreciate every officer and every minute of their service in what has become a very dangerous environment for so many.”

Mi’kmaq lobster fishers in southwestern Nova Scotia are asserting those rights in defence of the decision to set up licensed lobster fisheries for both feeding their communities and commercial sales in the area outside of the commercial lobster fishing season.

For weeks, non-Indigenous lobster fishers have targeted the Indigenous fishers and fisheries. On Friday, Sack said between 150 and 200 lobster traps were lost after non-Indigenous commercial fishers cut lines and destroyed buoys.

While the 1999 Supreme Court of Canada Marshall decision affirmed treaty rights to fish or hunt for a “moderate livelihood,” it also allows Ottawa to set regulations in consultation with Indigenous communities and for the purpose of conservation.

The definition of a “moderate livelihood” has not been agreed upon between the Sipekne’katik and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. However, Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan and Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett said in a statement last month that the Mi’kmaq have a constitutionally protected treaty right to fish under the term.

The Indigenous fishers have called on the RCMP and the federal government to intervene in the dispute, accusing the federal police force of not doing enough to protect the community.

On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appealed for calm and said violence and harassment are not acceptable.

“This is a situation that is extremely disconcerting,” Trudeau said. “That’s why we’re calling for an end to the violence and harassment that’s happening. … I understand the concerns and the conflict going on right now but we need to find a solution.”

RCMP said in a statement issued earlier in the week they were working to “de-escalate the situation and disperse the group.”

Senators representing Nova Scotia issued a statement Friday condemning the violence and calling on the RCMP to “restore peace and order.” They also called on the federal government to “move rapidly, respectfully and appropriately” to address the Indigenous fishers’ concerns.
