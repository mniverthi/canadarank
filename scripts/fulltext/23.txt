Party leaders' responses to a question about white privilege in this week's B.C. election debate have left some observers with big questions about a lack of understanding on issues of racism.

During Tuesday's debate, the leaders were asked to explain how they've reckoned with their own privileged positions as white people.

In one of the most talked about moments of the night, NDP Leader John Horgan spoke of playing lacrosse with Indigenous young people and suggested, "I did not see colour."

June Francis, co-chair of the Hogan's Alley Society board of directors, described that answer as "stunning" in light of this summer's protests over anti-Black racism, and said it demonstrates the depth of Horgan's privilege.

"It means that he can walk through the world and never confront racism," she told CBC.

NDP Leader John Horgan apologizes for race comment made during debate 1:03 John Horgan says he regrets saying he didn't see colour growing up on Vancouver Island when asked about how he's reckoning with his white privilege. Horgan says he's promising to do better in the future. 1:03

Francis said that as premier, it was Horgan's job to govern on behalf of everyone who lives in B.C., and if he's blind to race, he's also blind to the systemic racism that many British Columbians live with.

Horgan apologized for his comment immediately after the debate, calling it inappropriate and saying, "I'll never fully understand, as a white person, the lived reality of systemic racism. I'm listening, learning and I'll keep working every day to do better."

This is the answer I wish I gave on stage. Saying "I don’t see colour" causes pain and makes people feel unseen. I’m sorry. I’ll never fully understand, as a white person, the lived reality of systemic racism. I’m listening, learning, and I’ll keep working every day to do better. <a href="https://t.co/Rbr7h0JOyh">pic.twitter.com/Rbr7h0JOyh</a> —@jjhorgan

But for Genevieve Fuji Johnson, a political science professor at Simon Fraser University, that apology suggests Horgan still doesn't quite understand the issue.

"So often, colour blindness is synonymous for words like neutral and fair, and to make the suggestion that beliefs and behaviours and laws and policies and institutions are neutral or fair just totally glosses over the myriad of forms of oppression and indeed violence that racialized people and minorities face at the hands of supposedly neutral laws and institutions," she said.

Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson's answer to the same question was also troubling for some of those who watched the debate. In his response, the Liberal leader told a story about working as a doctor and delivering an Indigenous baby who was later named after him.

Francis said Wilkinson's answer didn't show any engagement with the issues that Indigenous people face in B.C.

"Instead, he told this story about himself and how glorious his experience was," she said. "It was deeply troubling, actually."

Wilkinson expanded on his comments Wednesday at a campaign stop in Kitimat, on B.C.'s North Coast.



"In medical practice, I became very much aware of the particular struggles of Indigenous people in dealing with the health-care system and in dealing with society's other structures,'' Wilkinson said. "The idea that people in our society are somehow treated differently because of the colour of their skin or where they grew up or who their parents are is not acceptable.''

He said he grew up fortunate as a white male and it wasn't until his teenage years that he realized he received different treatment than others.



"It's wrong. It's not fair,'' said Wilkinson. "I've suggested in the [Liberal] platform there should be anti-racism training for everybody in the provincial government.''

Green Party Leader Sonia Furstenau's response during the debate earned praise from some corners. Furstenau acknowledged the existence of systemic racism in the criminal justice system.

"We aren't all equal. I wish we were, but we're not," she said.

Francis said that answer was "fantastic" but that she remains concerned about the lack of diversity among Green Party candidates.

Fuji Johnson, on the other hand, said Furstenau missed an opportunity to discuss how systemic racism is pervasive in all Canadian institutions, from health care to education.

"I gave her a C, maybe a C+. I would say her response was adequate," Fuji Johnson said.

Indigenous issues missing from debate

Meanwhile, there were some other concerns about the debate's lack of focus on issues that matter to Indigenous communities.

CBC journalist Wawmeesh Hamilton pointed out that the only mention of reconciliation came during discussion of energy projects.

"I began to wonder, with no mention of it, if we reconciled. ... Did I miss something?" he said.

There was also nothing about the unique concerns of urban Indigenous people, who represent the majority of the Indigenous population in B.C.

In a similar vein, the Coalition on Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls in B.C. released an open letter Wednesday expressing "grave concern and disappointment" that none of the parties have released plans to implement the Calls for Justice of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.

Hamilton argued that the debate should have had an entire section devoted to the question of reconciliation. But as he noted, no Indigenous journalists were included on the panel that drafted questions for the party leaders.

"A step back was taken where reconciliation and Indigenous issues were concerned," he said. "Some soul searching needs to be done, stock should be taken and corrections need to be made."

He is the first Canadian to be treated with gene replacement therapy for a rare form of blindness which had left Sam unable to see sky on a cloudy day, and unable to make out shapes in the dark.

“Sometimes you have to walk in the night and I couldn’t see things and you bump into things,” Sam told CTV News.

He had to have lights on always, and had trouble seeing his shoes or objects on the floor. And the condition was progressive, meaning things would get worse as he grew older -- a daunting prospect when there was no treatment available.

But now he can see cloudy skies, shoes and more. The best part of his improved vision, says Sam, are the stars at night.

“I never saw stars before,” he said. “And I also never saw airplanes flying at night.”

He was diagnosed after birth with a genetic disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, a form of genetic retinal degeneration resulting from mutations in the RPE65 gene.

“You lose perception of light,” Dr. Elise Heon, of Sick Kids Hospital, explained to CTV News. “You end up in darkness and [it’s] slowly progressive, it's relentless, your visual field shrinks and shrinks and shrinks and shrinks.”

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) affects between 1 in 3,500 to 1 in 4,000 Canadians, according to Fighting Blindness Canada. It actually refers to a group of disorders, as there are numerous versions of RP depending on which pair of genes are damaged. More than 64 genes have been identified by scientists as potentially having mutations that cause RP.

Now, Canada has approved the first-ever gene replacement therapy for this form of blindness. Sick Kids Hospital has 29 children in its program with this mutation. The drug can be used on children and adults with the condition, but the earlier it’s used, the more sight it will save, doctors believe.

“It's a huge deal, because for these patients before, there’s no treatments,” Heon said.

She said she had recently met two patients, brothers, who were suffering the same problem as Sam, and for the first time, she was able to provide hope.

“They're 10 years old, and they're losing their vision,” she said. “If we do nothing, they're just going, fine, they'll just end up with no light reception. So for the first time [we were] able to say, well, actually we need to have a discussion. And it was just, it was priceless.”

The gene therapy, which goes by the brand name Luxturna, was developed in the U.S by the drug company Spark Therapeutics.

It works by placing a copy of the healthy gene into inactivated viruses, which are then injected into the retina. The gene then allows cells to produce the necessary protein to convert light into an electrical signal in the retina in order to provide healthy vision and prevent progression of the disease.

It is the first targeted gene therapy to be approved by Health Canada, which gave it the all-clear this week.

Back in 2019, Sam and his family travelled to the U.S to get the new gene therapy because it wasn’t available in Canada yet.

His mother, Sarah Banon, noticed changes quickly.

“About a week later, I noticed he could get dressed by [himself],” she said. “He could get his shoes on by himself, independently.”

His improvements have continued in the year since he first received the gene therapy.

“He is so much more confident,” his mother told CTV News. “Like getting dressed by himself, matching clothes, doesn’t have to have things enlarged. Being able to [see], even when it’s dark outside, no lights on and it is a cloudy day. He would have to, at school, keep the lights on.

“Now he is able to function as a normal child.”

With the approval of this gene therapy in Canada, doctors are hoping to be able to use it on more patients who qualify -- and the earlier the better.

Dr. Peter Kertes, a vitreo-retinal surgeon and Ophthalmologist-in-Chief at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, told CTV News that the approval of the therapy is “fantastic.”

“This is a huge breakthrough,” he said. “Most of the advances that we have in medicine are incremental. Every once in a while, once in a generation, something revolutionary like this comes along that really changes the course of therapy.”

Luxturna specifically treats individuals with biallelic mutations of the RPE65 gene -- meaning they have mutations in that gene stemming from both parents -- which manifests as either RP or Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). It’s a very small patient group compared to the entirety of Canadians with inherited retinal diseases.

This may be just one gene therapy for one condition, but it will open to the door to this strategy being used in other scenarios, Kertes pointed out.

“This is the tip of the iceberg. I think this is a vector that will prove to be very effective and holds great promise,” he said. “I think many people who are living with blindness or facing blindness, have much to look forward to. I think we're on the cusp of a revolution in this group of diseases.”

The company licensing the therapy, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc., isn’t detailing the cost, but based on the price in the U.S it could top $1.1 million in Canada, making it among the most expensive drugs in the country.

The therapy is currently under review by both the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) and the Institut national d’excellence en santé et en services sociaux (INESSS).

Novartis said in a statement that they “look forward to receiving their recommendations following Health Canada’s approval.”

They said they are eager “to help eligible Canadians affected by this rare disease gain access to the first-ever gene replacement therapy as quickly as possible.”

The Patented Medicine Prices Review Board will be disclosing their new guidelines in terms of capping drug prices in an online media briefing this Thursday.

As this will likely be the first of many gene replacement therapies -- with similarly high price tags -- Ottawa and the provinces will have to make the decision on whether it will be covered by provincial health plans. The question is an ongoing ethical debate, with some saying that drug companies will only take advantage of it if governments show that they are willing to pay.

“Should it be the responsibility for the government to pay for any drug at any price?” Marc-André Gagnon, a researcher with Carleton University who looks into pharmaceutical policy, told CTV News. “The problem is, if we say yes to this question, you can be sure that the day after, all the drugs in the market will be asking for much higher prices.”

“It’s a very expensive drug,” Heon acknowledged.

However, she pointed out that this is a rare disease, and it’s “not a recurrent treatment.” It’s a one-time injection to the eyes.

“You treat both eyes and then that’s it,” she said.

“To be able to change someone's life is quite a privilege. And to be able to prevent someone from going blind is a real privilege.”

For Sam and his mother, the gift of independence has been priceless.

“This is a story of hope,” his mother said. “A child told ‘it is what it is.’”
