In September, adherents to the far-reaching and baseless QAnon conspiracy ⁠— which falsely alleges the world is controlled by a Satanic cabal of pedophiles who are plotting against U.S. President Donald Trump ⁠— joined anti-mask and anti-vaccine protests in Montreal and Vancouver.

In July, a heavily armed military reservist from Manitoba who had posted memes on Instagram about the QAnon conspiracy rammed his truck through the gates of Rideau Hall . Minutes away from Parliament Hill, Rideau Hall is the official residence of Canada’s Governor General, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s temporary residence is on its grounds.

This is the third of a series of stories Emma McIntosh is writing as part of National Observer's special coverage of the U.S. election. Read the second story here .

QAnon started in October 2017, named after an anonymous poster going by “Q” on the far-right message board site 4chan who claimed to be a high-level government official with details on a secret war. Spiralling off an earlier conspiracy theory called Pizzagate, Q’s messages started as elaborate and far-fetched defences of Trump. But broader themes in QAnon ⁠— the idea that an embattled minority of people who know “the truth” are fighting back against elites and corrupt politicians ⁠— have caught on worldwide, spreading to mainstream social media platforms.

“There’s something unique about QAnon,” said Amarnath Amarasingam , an associate professor at Queen’s University and associate fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization, who co-authored a recent report on QAnon for the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.

The unfortunate cultural import from the United States has been kicking around Canada for years, though violent incidents with links to the conspiracy theory are still relatively rare. But QAnon has gained new prevalence here amid COVID-19 and the American presidential election, which presents a peculiar set of problems, experts say.

On Oct. 4, a political candidate in Saskatchewan resigned after clicking “like” on social media posts supporting QAnon. And a group of people that includes QAnon believers remains camped out on Parliament Hill after making headlines last month for attempting to place NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh under a “citizen’s arrest.”

“Our greatest responsibility is keeping Canadians safe. To fulfil that responsibility, our government and agencies must keep pace with evolving threats and global trends, such as the growing concerns of ideologically motivated violent extremism or the dissemination of hate speech,” said Mary-Liz Power, a press secretary for Blair, in a statement.

When asked by Canada’s National Observer whether the scenarios it’s considering involve violence carried out by QAnon supporters, the Prime Minister’s Office directed questions to the office of Public Safety Minister Bill Blair.

Last week, Trudeau said the Canadian government is readying itself for possible “ disruptions ” following the Nov. 3 vote.

“You might actually see some people engage in more violence,” he said.

However, Amarasingam is more concerned, arguing that the conspiracy has the potential to eventually become more of a threat. An election loss for Trump, for example, could be seen as an urgent call to action for QAnon supporters, he added.

“It’s an issue that merits watching, but it’s not the thing that’s going to bring down civilization as we know it,” said Phil Gurski, a former senior strategic analyst at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the president and CEO of Borealis Threat and Risk Consulting , whose specialty is typically Islamist extremism.

So far at least, the conspiracy appears to be far less prevalent north of the U.S. border. And although the FBI has designated QAnon a domestic terror threat in the U.S., Canadian authorities have so far made no such distinction here.

Canada, along with the United Kingdom and Australia, is one of the top countries producing QAnon content besides the U.S., according to a July report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a global think tank that studies extremism.

In a statement, NDP public safety critic Jack Harris said the government should be “vigilant” in assessing risk levels and in asking social media companies to act.

The Conservative Party of Canada declined to comment on whether the government should be doing more about QAnon.

“Canadians can be confident that our security agencies have the skills and resources necessary to detect, investigate and respond to both criminal and national security threats.”

“The government should be very clear with social media platforms that they have a responsibility to ensure that their platforms aren’t being used as a tool to spread dangerous and baseless conspiracy theories,” Harris said.

QAnon activity has increased amid COVID-19, U.S. election

For many of its followers, QAnon has proved to be addictive. In thousands of posts, or “Q Drops,” since the original in 2017, the anonymous person or people behind QAnon have left vague messages for the reader to interpret.

In general, the idea ⁠— however unsubstantiated and untethered to reality ⁠— is that Trump is fighting a secret war against a Satanic cabal of pedophiles, members of the global elite, who run a global child-trafficking network. The conspiracy also alleges that an ever-growing number of celebrities and politicians are involved, including former presidential candidate and first lady Hillary Clinton, and even high-profile Canadians like Trudeau.

It’s the type of conspiracy that thrives in the disinformation-rich environment created by Trump, Gurski said. Though it sounds as silly as conspiracies from decades past ⁠— think Area 51 or the moon landing ⁠— some people have stopped laughing, he added.

“They have suspended their powers of analysis, they have suspended their powers of critical thought, and they are taking it as true,” he said. “They are taking it as a call to action.”

The fact that followers must interpret Q’s hazy messages to attempt to understand them creates an almost religious element, said Amarasingam. People who “translate” the posts can gather large followings on social media, with information eventually circulating from darker corners of the internet to mainstream platforms where it reaches a wider audience.

“In a way, QAnon supporters have become like prophets … interpreting a sacred text,” he said.

The so-called Q drops are also cryptic enough that international audiences can find whatever meaning they want. For example, Vice documented attempts to fit the murders of Toronto billionaires Barry and Honey Sherman into the conspiracy in 2018.

The real power of QAnon, however, comes from the moral outrage inherent to its core ideas.

“If you truly believe that the world functions a certain way, that there are actually children being enslaved, the response would be the same for all of us,” Amarasingam said. “They come to accept a reality that would mobilize any of us. It’s just that we’re not seeing the same reality.”

This has spawned several serious incidents in the real world. In 2018, for example, a 30-year-old man from Nevada blocked off a bridge during a 90-minute standoff with police, four guns and 900 rounds of ammunition in his car. He was arrested without incident, and in letters to senior government officials after the fact, he used a QAnon slogan. In 2019, a 24-year-old from New York said in court that QAnon drove him to kill a mob boss.

In Canada, there has been one similar incident: that of the Manitoba reservist who crashed his truck through the gates of Rideau Hall. It’s not clear how much QAnon may have influenced the incident, but the fact that the man had shared two QAnon-related posts on social media did indicate he had dipped his toes in the waters of the conspiracy theory.

Not too many QAnon sightings over this past week, but here are some from Alberta and Saskatchewan.

In the U.S., the conspiracy has also driven dozens of congressional candidates to run for office this fall.

“It’s become this political-social movement,” Amarasingam said. “Because they have Trump on the inside, they feel like they can join him in the struggle and burn it all down from the inside.”

We haven’t seen anything on that level in Canada — the Saskatchewan candidate, for example, has denied being associated with QAnon and said “liking” posts isn’t equivalent to being a follower.

But QAnon still appears to be growing in North America and beyond. The ISD Global report found “major spikes” in online QAnon activity in March.

Part of that is likely to be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which upended much of our normal lives, Amarasingam said. Not only were a ton of people at home and spending more time in front of a computer than usual, but many had also been thrown into uncertain economic circumstances. Lack of social trust and an uprooting of norms have both historically been risk factors that make people more susceptible to conspiracy or extremist movements, he added.

“A lot of people’s response to (COVID-19) was … a sense of chaos,” he said. “A lot of what we thought we knew, we didn’t believe in anymore.”

In times of trouble, many people tend to look for someone to blame, former CSIS analyst Gurski said. A polarized election in the U.S. and rising levels of hate make it a “perfect storm,” he added.

“We’re already in an environment where a lot of people are afraid, they’re upset, they’re angry, at either real or perceived lack of action by their government when it comes to COVID, when it comes to the economy, and the U.S. election.”

The ISD Global report also pointed to the Nov. 3 U.S. election as an important factor. Researchers have said they believe Russian-backed organizations are attempting to amplify QAnon content online in the run-up to the vote, seeing it as an opportunity to sow division in the U.S.

The FBI has identified QAnon as a domestic terror threat. “The FBI assesses these conspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace, occasionally driving both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts,” the agency said in a memo first reported by Yahoo News. Those incidents may increase as the election draws nearer, the document noted.

The view from Canada is different.

“The RCMP is aware of this movement, however, the RCMP does not investigate movements or organizations for their ideological dispositions,” RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Caroline Duval said in an emailed statement to Canada’s National Observer.

“We investigate criminal activities by those who threaten the safety and security of Canadians.”

Gurski said he wouldn’t disagree with the RCMP’s view and that he believes QAnon hasn’t yet reached a level of critical momentum in Canada the way it has in the U.S. The Rideau Hall incident is just one example, and the public doesn’t have a lot of information about what led to it, he added.

Though QAnon exists here, it hasn’t reached the same proportions as it has south of the border. Canada also lacks open-carry gun laws that exist in many U.S. states, which make for a more dangerous set of circumstances, he added.

“I would argue … (QAnon) wouldn’t be high on the list (of priorities) right now,” Gurski said of QAnon. “Could it change? Absolutely.”

I been doing what I can as well... retweeting , commenting on the MAGA. Very sad and scary. Rally here in Ottawa on Saturday against masks...

How do you stop an online conspiracy movement?

It’s very difficult to reason with QAnon adherents directly, Amarasingam said. “The same systems of expertise or knowledge that we turn to, to explain fact and fiction, they dismiss it in its entirety.”

It’s also difficult to identify them or count how many people are involved ⁠— in Canada and in the U.S., the movement has coalesced both online and in real life with other right-wing causes, meaning a lot of people dabble in it without fully going along, said Barbara Perry, director of the Centre on Hate, Bias and Extremism at Ontario Tech University. It’s now linked to broader white supremacist, anti-Semitic, anti-authority and anti-vaccine movements, and it’s easy for people to passively participate in a low-risk way by “liking” and “sharing” content.

“It’s a little bit of cherry-picking going on in terms of people jumping in and out of conspiracy platforms ... taking on the pieces that seem to help them make sense of their lives,” Perry said.

For example, QAnon supporters joined with another far-right group called the Yellow Vests in 2019 protests in Ottawa, Perry said. And QAnon believers are part of a fringe group that has camped out on Parliament Hill since Canada Day, which attempted last month to execute a “citizen’s arrest” on several people and accosted federal NDP Leader Singh. On Facebook, Perry said, QAnon content has often been buried among other right-wing causes.

“As it goes internationally, you may see more of that,” Amarasingam said of QAnon blending with other far-right ideologies. It needs to adapt and align with other movements to keep gaining momentum, he added.

It’s also important to remember that most people who believe in QAnon will never become violent, Gurski said.

No one has really figured out how to stop fringe conspiracy theories, especially once they hit the mainstream. But past studies of extremist movements give us an idea of where to start.

Priority one: Booting QAnon off major social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

“It has become just as problematic as when ISIS was thriving on Twitter and Facebook in 2013 and 2014,” Amarasingam said.

Platforms have now started to do just that. Twitter took steps to limit QAnon content in July, and Facebook initiated a crackdown this month that saw top QAnon influencers deleted there and on Instagram. One top QAnon influencer in Quebec who disseminated COVID-19 conspiracy theories to tens of thousands of followers was kicked off Facebook in that sweep.

Extremely dedicated QAnon believers will likely attempt to regroup, both on the same platforms and others that may inhabit darker corners of the internet, Amarasingam said.

“They just kind of chase their tail for a while. That’s generally a good thing,” he said, adding that it’s better they spend time making new accounts than spreading their messages.

Removing them from the biggest platforms can also limit the number of people who see conspiracy content ⁠— your unsuspecting grandma, for example, is unlikely to seek out Q drops on 4chan, but might unwittingly encounter QAnon posts shared by Facebook friends who didn’t realize what they were disseminating.

Though conspiracy theories always have hardcore believers, the people they want to win over are the “mushy middle” who aren’t firm adherents but might uncritically accept portions of it, Perry said.

In some ways, the “genie is out of the bottle” already, Perry said. People can easily switch up their language and find ways to get around restrictions on platforms, and conspiracy movements can use the crackdowns to lend credibility to complaints that their movement is being silenced.

Amarasingam said so far, crackdown efforts appear to be making a difference, cutting out some of the most prominent QAnon voices and groups. But whether the changes will work in the long term is unclear — social media platforms must stay vigilant to prevent conspiracy theorists from regrouping, he added.

“It’s really a question of sustained pressure,” he said.

An added challenge, he said, is that QAnon believers tend to be middle-aged or older. In the past, anti-extremism programming has been aimed at men in their 20s who are vulnerable to some types of radicalization ⁠— strategies used there likely won’t work on older people, he added.

“We haven’t actually thought about what that looks like, to try to help old people,” he said.

Of course, the outcome of the presidential election is also likely to have an impact on what happens next. A Trump victory could legitimize the movement, Amarasingam said. But a Trump loss ⁠— which polling indicates is more likely ⁠— could also galvanize it, depending on whether the president commits to a peaceful transfer of power.

Gurski said it’s likely that CSIS and the RCMP are watching the issue.

“If there’s any indication that it might be veering towards violence, it would be taken seriously ⁠— if, and this is a big if, the resources are available,” he said. “Those resources have to be taken from somewhere.”

In an interview with Canada’s National Observer editor-in-chief Linda Solomon Wood last week, former CSIS director Richard Fadden called for a royal commission on the problem of disinformation. And although Canadians are quick to dismiss extremism at home as the work of a “couple nutbars,” he added, the country could benefit from open conversations about such problems.

“I don't mean to exaggerate, but democracy is not going to work unless people are able to compromise, dialogue and talk. It seems to me, there's rather less of that,” Fadden said.

Governments could also think bigger, Perry said. Older people are influenced by their peers, much like any other age group , so could labour movements and employers, for example, be mobilized to help?

Perry also said governments could look at legislation aimed at stopping disinformation, and even take steps to redefine terrorism.

“We really have to get to the adults,” she said. “They’re more set in their ways ... We’ve got to find ways to disrupt that.” Some Carleton University students are expressing concern about software being used to guard against cheating during online exams.

The university says most instructors have adapted their courses to avoid timed exams during the COVID-19 pandemic, but a small number still require them.

For those, students are required to download one of two proctor programs that access their web cameras. The programs then monitor the student at random intervals during the exam to make sure they're not cheating.

"The university is trying to recreate a reality that just isn't attainable," said Matt Gagne, president of the Carleton Academic Student Government, which acts as an intermediary between students, faculty and school administrators.

Carleton says the two programs, called CoMaS and Big Blue Button, were developed at the university and have been used on campus for years. In a statement, the university said the programs "are not intrusive AI-powered software or external service providers."

That means the programs don't allow remote access to the computers on which they're installed, so they can't spy on files, browsing history or other applications.

But Gagne said students still have privacy concerns.

"It's also having to put in a camera into every student's home, when students are coming from a lot of different backgrounds where they might not be comfortable with that," he said.

For example, what if a roommate accidentally walks in on a student who's taking an exam, Gagne asked.

"If a prof sees that and deems it as suspicious behaviour, they could fail a student because of that," he said.

Gagne is asking the university to come up with a different way to monitor timed exams, especially when students are already under added stress due to the pandemic.

"We should be looking for more compassion from the university on this, not less," he said.

Many faculty members agree.

"This is a difficult time for students and for instructors," said Angelo Mingarelli, president of the Carleton University Academic Staff Association. He's suggesting alternatives including open-book exams, or administering multiple versions of exams to limit the chance of cheating.

"We have software, we have machines, we have programs that can do this, and it keeps the privacy concerns of individuals safe," he said.

Carleton said students concerned about privacy can discuss the issue with their instructors to see if there's some other way to take the exam.

« Ça a commencé, je ne sais pas, à 5 h du matin. J’entends cogner assez fort, je dis : “Un instant, je m’habille.” J’étais en sous-vêtements. “Non, non. On défonce à trois!” »

Serge Lépine a été arrêté lors de la rafle policière dans la nuit du vendredi 16 octobre, dans la foulée de la Loi des mesures de guerre qui suspendait les libertés civiles. Il a 25 ans et étudie à l'École d’architecture de l’Université Laval. Il milite également pour le logement social avec sa conjointe d’alors, Danielle Boulanger, dans le quartier Saint-Sauveur à Québec. Il n’entretient aucun lien avec le Front de libération du Québec (FLQ).

Serge est le jeune frère de ma mère. Pendant des années, la famille n’a jamais vraiment su ce qui lui était arrivé. Personne n’en parlait, c’était une sorte de tabou. Quant à Serge, les premiers souvenirs de son emprisonnement lui sont revenus 40 ans plus tard. Comme si son inconscient avait masqué les souvenirs les plus traumatisants de sa détention. Aujourd’hui, il a envie de donner un sens à ce qu’il a vécu.

Voici son histoire.

Il y a huit policiers, dont quatre de la Sûreté du Québec et quatre de la Ville de Québec, qui rentrent d’un coup dans l’appartement! On me met les menottes, je suis assis sur mon lit en état de choc. Serge Lépine

J’ai compris qu’ils sont quatre pour Danielle et quatre pour moi. Ils fouillent partout. Ils me disent qu’en vertu de la Loi des mesures de guerre proclamée quelques minutes avant mon arrestation, ils vont me mettre en prison sans mandat. Je ne pose pas de questions. Je suis probablement surpris. Je ne me souviens pas, mais ils ont dû me demander où était Danielle. Je ne sais pas ce que j’ai répondu.

Serge se tient devant la maison du 271, rue Saint-Vallier Ouest, où il habitait il y a 50 ans. Photo : Radio-Canada / Ivanoh Demers

Danielle n’est pas dans l’appartement au moment de l’arrestation de Serge, car elle est hospitalisée. Les policiers emportent avec eux des documents dans des boîtes et embarquent Serge dans la voiture en direction de la prison d’Orsainville.

Durant le trajet, ils le gardent menotté. Ils ne lui parlent pas. Serge est conduit dans le garage souterrain et rejoint une cinquantaine d’autres personnes qui sont déjà là, qui viennent d’être arrêtées aussi.

Je me souviens, dit-il, à mon arrivée dans le garage de la prison, j’ai reconnu quelques personnes et puis quelqu’un a crié à l’endroit de tous : "Non, pas Lépine!" Il voulait sans doute dire "ils arrêtent même les militants d’un comité de citoyens qui n’avait pas la réputation d’être à gauche".

Les nouveaux détenus sont pris en charge par les gardiens en même temps que les prisonniers de droit commun. Prise de photos et d’empreintes, mise à nu, examen médical sommaire, pesée, rasage des cheveux et de la barbe. Ensuite, les vêtements de prisonniers, puis direction des cellules...

Pour ma part, j'étais angoissé, mais silencieux et discret, en attente du pire. Serge Lépine

Avec la disparition de mon oncle, les événements ont pris une tournure plus dramatique. Je me souviens de l’appel de ma grand-mère pour annoncer que Serge avait disparu. Il habitait un appartement au sous-sol de la maison familiale sur la rue Saint-Vallier Ouest, à Québec; très vite ma grand-mère a fait le lien avec l’opération de ratissage qui était en cours. D’ailleurs l’état de l’appartement, qui était dans un grand désordre à la suite des fouilles policières, en était un signe évident.

Je revois aussi mon père multiplier les appels auprès des corps policiers pour tenter de retrouver Serge, mais en vain, évidemment.

Les événements étaient si près de nous. Dans ma tête d’enfant, je percevais une menace sourde qui planait comme si des ombres noires étaient tapies derrière les arbres du jardin et nous épiaient sans cesse. J’habitais Saint-Lambert et je voyais les soldats garder la rue où résidait la famille Laporte… l’armée... les soldats... un spectacle ahurissant… tout le monde était sous le choc, ahuri.

Pendant ce temps à Orsainville, Serge ne savait pas de quoi demain serait fait.

Mon oncle a mis trente ans avant de pouvoir regarder le film Les ordres de Michel Brault sur les événements de la crise d’Octobre.

Les conditions de détention à Orsainville étaient pires que celles montrées dans le film, dit-il. Sauf que je n’ai pas été victime d’une exécution factice.

Serge se souvient d’avoir été nourri une fois par jour avec des toasts molles, du gruau dans un gobelet en papier et du café insipide :

Les lumières étaient ouvertes 24 heures par jour, on était confinés tout le temps dans la cellule, on ne sortait jamais, pas d’accès dans une salle commune, pas de sorties dans la cour pour prendre l’air, pas de douche, pas de livres, pas de journaux, pas de TV, pas de papier ou de crayon, pas de téléphone et aucune visite ou pas d’avocat, alors que c’est un droit fondamental! Serge Lépine

La seule activité permise était d’arpenter sa cellule de 2 mètres sur 4 mètres, raconte-t-il. Après quelques jours d'incarcération, il a eu droit à la cantine; soit du tabac à cigarette et du papier à rouler notamment.

Les détenus sont maintenus sous une chape de plomb, coupés du monde extérieur; ils n’ont rien su de l’assassinat de Pierre Laporte le 17 octobre, enlevé par les membres de la cellule Chénier et dont le corps a été retrouvé le même jour.

Néanmoins, Serge parvient à échanger des bribes d’information avec ses deux voisins de cellule à voix basse. Les voix étaient audibles en raison des revêtements de béton dans le corridor, se souvient-il.

J’entendais mon voisin de gauche pleurer, car il ne pouvait obtenir de nouvelles de sa conjointe qui devait accoucher d’un jour à l’autre et mon voisin de droite craignait d’être battu, car il était un ennemi personnel du directeur de la prison. Moi, je pensais à ce moment-là que c’était un indicateur qui cherchait à me tirer les vers du nez, car c’est lui qui m’a dit que Pierre Laporte était mort, d’où tenait-il ces informations? Curieux tout de même. C’est ce qui a alimenté ma méfiance envers lui.

L’historien Jacques Lacoursière rapporte, quant à lui, dans son livre publié en 1972 Alarme citoyens! L’affaire Cross-Laporte du connu à l’inconnu que des gardiens de la prison d’Orsainville auraient causé des sévices à deux détenus dans la nuit qui a suivi l’annonce de la mort de Pierre Laporte.

La règle était simple en ces temps troublés, tranche mon oncle.

C’était la Loi des mesures d’exception, ils pouvaient nous sacrer une volée, il n’y a pas personne qui en aurait été témoin. À Montréal, y'en a qui se sont fait tabasser, il y eut même un simulacre d'exécution. Serge Lépine faisant notamment allusion au film Les ordres

Intimidation et chantage psychologique en prison

Autres traitements-chocs réservés aux détenus d’Orsainville, les interrogatoires de nuit avec des policiers de la Sûreté du Québec.

C’est arrivé à Serge à quelques reprises. Par exemple, on lui demandait qui il connaissait, quels étaient ses contacts. À un autre moment, pour l’intimider encore plus, on lui a dit qu’il était en dedans pour longtemps.

Une autre nuit, raconte Serge; Y’en a deux qui sont venus me chercher dans ma cellule. Alors je leur demande : "Où est-ce qu’on va? Tu vas le savoir!", me répondent-ils. Vraiment une caricature de Good Cop Bad Cop. Le méchant me dit : "On est allés chercher ta blonde à l’hôpital, on l’a embarquée." Moi je ne montre aucune réaction, même aucune colère, mais rationnellement je me dis qu’il bluffe. Voir si on va embarquer quelqu’un qui est hospitalisé, ça ne se pouvait pas.

À sa libération, Serge a été soulagé de constater que Danielle n’a pas été arrêtée ni emprisonnée. En fait, elle est revenue à leur appartement quelques jours avant la sortie de prison de Serge.

Il aura passé 15 jours en dedans.

Pour ne pas devenir fou, dit-il, j’essayais d’occuper mon esprit en faisant des mathématiques dans ma tête ou j’essayais de m’intéresser aux détails architecturaux des cellules de l’aile que j'apercevais par la fenêtre de ma cellule. Je ne me souviens pas de mon état d’anxiété, de mes peurs et de mes appréhensions, je dirais en état de choc, coupé complètement de mes émotions.

Aucune accusation n’a été portée contre lui, comme ce fut le cas pour la plupart (87,5 %) des 497 personnes arrêtées lors de la promulgation des mesures de guerre.

Je ne le croyais pas, j’étais encore en état de choc , se rappelle mon oncle.

Quand mon oncle a été libéré, Serge n’a rien dit, rien raconté de son incarcération à la prison d’Orsainville, et je crois bien que du côté de la famille, peu ou pas de questions lui ont été posées, par crainte d’être maladroit peut-être...

Plusieurs victimes d’Octobre ont relaté après leur libération avoir senti une certaine indifférence de la part de la société et des médias ou une totale méconnaissance des faits quant au sort qui leur avait été réservé dans les prisons. Ces prisonniers d’Octobre étaient notamment des intellectuels, des étudiants, des artistes, des avocats et des syndicalistes, pour la plupart indépendantistes.

Dans la famille, nous évoquions discrètement entre nous ce qui était arrivé à Serge, mais sans en savoir beaucoup. Je me rappelle une discussion que nous avons eue, mes cousins et moi, avec mon oncle sur son arrestation en octobre 1970, lors d’une fête de famille il y a quelques années, mais les confins de l'histoire nous échappaient toujours.

On m’a relâché sans rien me dire, pas d’excuses non plus. D’après Danielle, je suis allé chez une de mes tantes pour parler à quelqu’un. Je suis retourné à mes cours à l’École d’architecture, où j’ai été accueilli par les applaudissements des étudiants. Autour de moi, à l'université ou encore au Comité des citoyens où je militais, je n’ai senti aucun rejet. Mais j’ai en effet subi un choc post-traumatique, puisque j’ai demandé, selon ma conjointe d’alors, Danielle, de dormir les lumières allumées pendant 3 mois.

Serge s’est souvenu de son retour à la maison il y a un an seulement. Et encore aujourd'hui, il ne sait toujours pas pourquoi il a été arrêté lors de la crise d’Octobre. Serge pense que c’est en raison du rôle qu’il a joué avec Danielle dans le Comité de citoyens qu’ils ont fondé en 1968, dans le quartier Saint-Sauveur à Québec.

Serge et Danielle voulaient contribuer au développement du logement social dans ce quartier ouvrier et Serge s’impliquait à titre d'étudiant en architecture.

Il pense que leur militantisme et leur engagement auraient contrarié les organisateurs politiques libéraux (les mêmes aux niveaux fédéral, provincial et municipal à l’époque) de la Ville de Québec et que c’est de cette façon qu’il se serait retrouvé sur la liste des personnes à arrêter.

Ils ont voulu, dit Serge, nous stigmatiser en nous associant au FLQ, afin de nuire à la réputation du Comité des citoyens. C’était une organisation atypique qui embêtait les partis traditionnels. Il fallait donc arrêter les deux membres fondateurs. J’ai été arrêté parce que je faisais partie de ces listes-là comme étant une personne progressiste, qui avait un intérêt pour l’indépendance.

Avec le temps, Serge a pris du recul et il a, à l'occasion, écrit sur les événements d'Octobre.

J’ai été emporté avec 497 autres personnes dans cette faille intemporelle, isolé dans une cellule pendant 15 jours. À la fin, on m’a relâché sans rien me dire. La démocratie est bien fragile, il ne faut surtout pas laisser les autres s’en occuper à notre place. Il faut rester vigilant; il faut toujours que quelqu’un monte la garde.

Serge me remercie, car, dit-il, le projet d’article l’a aidé à revenir sur cette période. Ça m’a amené à lire plusieurs livres sur la crise d’Octobre et à me positionner clairement. J’ai même consulté pour mieux comprendre pourquoi j’avais occulté pendant toutes ces années les événements traumatiques que j’ai subis.

Je comprends que cela lui aura pris 50 ans avant d’atteindre une certaine sérénité, le début peut-être d’un processus qui l’amènera à faire la paix avec le passé brutal d’Octobre.
