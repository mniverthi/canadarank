Is it time to rewind and turn an abandoned Blockbuster store into a museum?

Scoff all you want, but an online petition that began this summer is asking for it to actually happen in Ontario for the former video rental business.

Andrew Stuart, of Cambridge, has set a goal of getting 1,000 people to sign up to support the idea of transforming an empty Blockbuster store near Georgian Bay into a global shrine.

“Just outside Owen Sound, Georgian Bluffs has one of the last intact Blockbusters in the world,” Stuart wrote in the petition. “This site is of great importance to millions of people across the globe who grew up with this icon. Imagine getting to share the magic of Blockbuster with future generations by keeping this potential museum intact.

Stuart was thinking about the economic boost if his idea came to fruition.

“This historic building could provide some much-needed tourism and economic growth to the area for Owen Sound and all of Grey Bruce. I know I stop in and reminisce from time to time.”

As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 790 people have signed the petition.

The push to make the building a heritage site has seen minor support on social media, with people sharing images of the empty building after making a stop on their journey through the area.

“I found a Blockbuster in Georgian Bluffs, Ont. They should make this a heritage site!” wrote Robleh Jama on Twitter back in July. B.C. health officials announced 155 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total number of cases since the pandemic began to 11,189 provincewide.

There are currently 1,513 active cases of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, as well as 3,713 people who are under active public health monitoring as a result of exposure to known cases, according to a news release Friday from the Ministry of Health.

Of those active cases, 72 people are in hospital with 26 in intensive care.

There has been one new death from the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total provincial death toll to 251.

Health officials say 9,387 people in B.C. have recovered from the virus.

On Thursday, Henry's update included the first confirmed case of multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), a rare condition found in children, that has been linked to COVID-19 through laboratory tests.

MIS-C has clinical similarities to Kawasaki Disease, with symptoms including fever, abdominal pain, rashes, conjunctivitis and inflammation around the mouth, hands and feet.

Henry said the case is a good reminder that while COVID-19 is generally less severe in children, no age group is immune from suffering serious illness caused by the novel coronavirus.

New outbreak in Merritt

Health officials say there has been one new community outbreak at the main Tim Hortons restaurant in Merritt leading the establishment to close voluntarily.



The Interior Health authority says the business had precautions in place to prevent transmission to the public and its investigation has determined there was no exposure to the general public.



It says all confirmed cases are isolating while contact tracing is underway and the authority will increase testing capacity in Merritt to address any possible additional demands, nor is there any evidence that COVID-19 is spread through food made by infected people.

There also continues to be exposure events around the province which are posted on the websites of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control and health authorities.

There are no new outbreaks in the health-care system. The outbreak at Kin Village has been declared over. leaving 15 active outbreaks in long-term care and assisted living and two in acute care units of hospitals.

Voting safely

Henry reminds British Columbians that the provincial election is just over a week away and that advanced voting is available throughout the province. She says Elections BC has COVID-19 safety plans in place for all locations.

"If you are planning on voting in person, remember to give others the space to stay safe when going to vote, wash your hands before and after voting, and consider using a mask if distancing is a challenge," Henry stated in the written statement.

She says those who are self-isolating or feeling unwell can still vote without going to a voting place and should contact Elections BC at 1 800 661-8683 for more information or assistance.

Flu shots please

Henry reiterated this week the importance of getting vaccinated for the flu. She said sooner is better than later, but it's best to get a flu shot by late October or early November.

Though demand has been unusually high this year and some pharmacies are already reporting running out of the vaccine, Henry said supplies will be replenished throughout the season.B.C. health officials announced 155 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total number of cases since the pandemic began to 11,189 provincewide.

The Liberals took the first shot, when Quebec MP Greg Fergus — who is also the chair of the Parliamentary Black Caucus in Ottawa — condemned how the Conservative candidate in York Centre posted on Twitter about U.S. vice presidential contender Kamala Harris’s racial identity.

Fergus shared a screenshot of the post, which was dated Aug. 13. In it, Tory candidate Julius Tiangson replied to another, unseen tweet by seemingly comparing the ethnicities of Harris to then-Conservative leadership contender Leslyn Lewis.

Lewis is Black and Harris is Black and South Asian.

“Leslyn Lewis is legit Black,” Tiangson wrote. “Kamala Harris is transracial (a racial fluidity concept that identifies oneself to a particular usefulness…)!”

Fergus called on Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole to immediately “fire” Tiangson for the comment, which he said the Liberals found in a cached version of the candidate’s now-deleted Twitter account.

“It almost sounds like (he is saying) she’s just using it, to instrumentalize her race for advantage. I don’t know what planet he’s on. It hasn’t been much of an advantage, when you’re facing anti-Black racism,” Fergus said.

“And what is ‘legit Black’? Am I ‘legit Black’? Where is he going with this?”

Tiangson responded with a written statement to the Star, accusing the Liberals of trying to “distract voters here from the many ethical scandals surrounding this government.

“As an ethnic minority who immigrated to this country, I think it’s great to see Kamala Harris running for vice president,” said Tiangson, who came to Canada from the Philippines in 1985.

“Liberals using an out of context tweet won’t derail the hard work we’re doing to stand up for the Canadians left behind by this government.”

Tiangson’s campaign did not respond to a followup question about the context of his tweet.

O’Toole’s office also did not respond to a request for comment Friday.

Hours later, Conservatives unearthed a tweet of their own — this one from the Liberal candidate running in the other byelection in Toronto Centre, former CTV host Marci Ien. Dated May 2011, months before she was named co-host of the network’s Canada AM morning show, Ien posted on Twitter about watching a 9/11 conspiracy theory documentary.

“Watching ‘Loose Change 9-11: An American Coup’. Really makes you think about what really happened on September 11, 2001,” she wrote.

That film, one version of which was co-produced by the radical American conspiracist Alex Jones, has been widely criticized for spreading misinformation.

Cory Hann, the Conservative party’s director of communications, said on Twitter that Ien should apologize and resign for “peddling” conspiracy theories.

“These truther conspiracies have long been debunked, and only serve to harm the families of the thousands of victims of this terror attack,” Hann said.

“She shouldn’t just apologize, she should resign.”

In an email to the Star Friday evening, Ien said she posted the tweet after watching parts of the film on YouTube nine years ago.

“I regret the impression it leaves, as I have always been so deeply saddened by the horrific destruction and tragic loss caused by al-Qaeda’s attacks on 9/11,” she wrote.

“Throughout my career as a journalist and broadcaster, I’ve spoken repeatedly with the families of 9/11 victims and shared their stories — as a candidate, I firmly believe that keeping Canadians safe from such tragedies must always be a foremost priority of every parliamentarian.”

The competing calls for opponents to drop out come as tens of thousands of people can begin voting in advance polls in Toronto Centre and York Centre, where federal byelections are being held amidst the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada’s biggest city.

The seats are empty after Liberal MPs Michael Levitt and Bill Morneau, the former finance minister, resigned this summer.

The elections are scheduled for Oct. 26.
