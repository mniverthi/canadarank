Is it time to rewind and turn an abandoned Blockbuster store into a museum?

Scoff all you want, but an online petition that began this summer is asking for it to actually happen in Ontario for the former video rental business.

Andrew Stuart, of Cambridge, has set a goal of getting 1,000 people to sign up to support the idea of transforming an empty Blockbuster store near Georgian Bay into a global shrine.

“Just outside Owen Sound, Georgian Bluffs has one of the last intact Blockbusters in the world,” Stuart wrote in the petition. “This site is of great importance to millions of people across the globe who grew up with this icon. Imagine getting to share the magic of Blockbuster with future generations by keeping this potential museum intact.

Stuart was thinking about the economic boost if his idea came to fruition.

“This historic building could provide some much-needed tourism and economic growth to the area for Owen Sound and all of Grey Bruce. I know I stop in and reminisce from time to time.”

As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 790 people have signed the petition.

The push to make the building a heritage site has seen minor support on social media, with people sharing images of the empty building after making a stop on their journey through the area.

“I found a Blockbuster in Georgian Bluffs, Ont. They should make this a heritage site!” wrote Robleh Jama on Twitter back in July.
