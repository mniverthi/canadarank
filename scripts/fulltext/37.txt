Just $1.99 per week for the first 24 weeks

Just $1.99 per week for the first 24 weeks OTTAWA—In duelling expressions of outrage, Liberals and Conservatives exchanged demands for opposing candidates to drop out of federal byelections in Toronto as advance polls opened on Friday.

The Liberals took the first shot, when Quebec MP Greg Fergus — who is also the chair of the Parliamentary Black Caucus in Ottawa — condemned how the Conservative candidate in York Centre posted on Twitter about U.S. vice presidential contender Kamala Harris’s racial identity.

Fergus shared a screenshot of the post, which was dated Aug. 13. In it, Tory candidate Julius Tiangson replied to another, unseen tweet by seemingly comparing the ethnicities of Harris to then-Conservative leadership contender Leslyn Lewis.

Lewis is Black and Harris is Black and South Asian.

“Leslyn Lewis is legit Black,” Tiangson wrote. “Kamala Harris is transracial (a racial fluidity concept that identifies oneself to a particular usefulness…)!”

Fergus called on Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole to immediately “fire” Tiangson for the comment, which he said the Liberals found in a cached version of the candidate’s now-deleted Twitter account.

“It almost sounds like (he is saying) she’s just using it, to instrumentalize her race for advantage. I don’t know what planet he’s on. It hasn’t been much of an advantage, when you’re facing anti-Black racism,” Fergus said.

“And what is ‘legit Black’? Am I ‘legit Black’? Where is he going with this?”

Tiangson responded with a written statement to the Star, accusing the Liberals of trying to “distract voters here from the many ethical scandals surrounding this government.

“As an ethnic minority who immigrated to this country, I think it’s great to see Kamala Harris running for vice president,” said Tiangson, who came to Canada from the Philippines in 1985.

“Liberals using an out of context tweet won’t derail the hard work we’re doing to stand up for the Canadians left behind by this government.”

Tiangson’s campaign did not respond to a followup question about the context of his tweet.

O’Toole’s office also did not respond to a request for comment Friday.

Hours later, Conservatives unearthed a tweet of their own — this one from the Liberal candidate running in the other byelection in Toronto Centre, former CTV host Marci Ien. Dated May 2011, months before she was named co-host of the network’s Canada AM morning show, Ien posted on Twitter about watching a 9/11 conspiracy theory documentary.

“Watching ‘Loose Change 9-11: An American Coup’. Really makes you think about what really happened on September 11, 2001,” she wrote.

That film, one version of which was co-produced by the radical American conspiracist Alex Jones, has been widely criticized for spreading misinformation.

Cory Hann, the Conservative party’s director of communications, said on Twitter that Ien should apologize and resign for “peddling” conspiracy theories.

“These truther conspiracies have long been debunked, and only serve to harm the families of the thousands of victims of this terror attack,” Hann said.

“She shouldn’t just apologize, she should resign.”

In an email to the Star Friday evening, Ien said she posted the tweet after watching parts of the film on YouTube nine years ago.

“I regret the impression it leaves, as I have always been so deeply saddened by the horrific destruction and tragic loss caused by al-Qaeda’s attacks on 9/11,” she wrote.

“Throughout my career as a journalist and broadcaster, I’ve spoken repeatedly with the families of 9/11 victims and shared their stories — as a candidate, I firmly believe that keeping Canadians safe from such tragedies must always be a foremost priority of every parliamentarian.”

The competing calls for opponents to drop out come as tens of thousands of people can begin voting in advance polls in Toronto Centre and York Centre, where federal byelections are being held amidst the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada’s biggest city.

The seats are empty after Liberal MPs Michael Levitt and Bill Morneau, the former finance minister, resigned this summer.

The elections are scheduled for Oct. 26.

But Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole says if Ambassador Cong Peiwu does not publicly apologize for his “belligerent” comments, which O’Toole called a threat to Canadians, Ottawa should kick him out.

In a statement Friday, O’Toole took a much harder line than the Liberal government did — at least publicly — to comments made by Cong in a virtual news conference Thursday on the 50th anniversary of Canada-China diplomatic ties. That’s when Cong warned Canada against emboldening Hong Kong “criminals” and against interfering in China’s internal affairs.

O’Toole said if no apology is offered, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should immediately withdraw Cong’s diplomatic credentials.

“The Chinese ambassador has decided to engage in belligerent rhetoric unbecoming of his office,” said O’Toole. “To be clear, this was a threat to the 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong. And a barely veiled one at that.”

“It was of the kind of tone and tenor one would expect from someone seeking protection money — not someone who is the official emissary of a member of the United Nations Security Council.”

“A threat to Canadians anywhere, is a threat to Canadians everywhere,” he added.

O’Toole repeated long-standing calls on the Liberal government to expedite entry to Canada for pro-democracy protestors and political refugees fleeing Hong Kong and to impose sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, which target officials individually for human rights violations, “against those responsible for imposing a draconian national security law” in Hong Kong, which he said violates the Sino-British Joint Declaration, an international treaty.

Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Thursday he asked Global Affairs to call in the ambassador “to make clear in no uncertain terms that Canada will always stand up for human rights and the rights of Canadians around the world.”

Global Affairs officials confirmed to the Star they met with the ambassador Thursday and delivered the message.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday his government isn’t looking “to escalate” tensions with China, but it will not stand down on its advocacy for human rights or “calling out China for its coercive diplomacy.”

Trudeau says China’s 2018 detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor is unjustified, tied to China’s demand that Canada release Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who is battling extradition from Canada to the U.S.

“We will make sure that China knows that not only are we standing up for human rights, calling on a safe return of the two Michaels who’ve been arbitrarily detained, but we stand with allies around the world and the United States, to Australia, to Great Britain, to European nations, to many nations in every corner of the world who share these concerns.”

In a news conference by zoom Thursday, the Chinese ambassador warned the Canadian government against admitting Hong Kong dissidents as refugees, or any action to declare China’s treatment of its Uighur minority population as “genocide” as a group of MPs and senators have called for. He said Kovrig and Spavor are in the hands of China’s “independent” judicial system.

“We strongly urge the Canadian side not (to) grant so-called political asylum to those violent criminals in Hong Kong because it is the interference in China’s domestic affairs and certainly it will embolden those violent criminals,” he said.

“So if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and prosperity in Hong Kong and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crime…to make sure the one country, two systems is most definitely and comprehensively implemented in Hong Kong.”

Cong later denied he was making any threat. “That’s your interpretation,” he told a Star reporter.

O’Toole chided the ambassador: “Canada is a smaller country on an economic basis when compared to China, but our commitment to liberty, human rights, and the rule of law towers above the conduct of this ambassador.”
