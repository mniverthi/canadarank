Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland hold a press conference in Ottawa, July 16, 2020. Canada has run up the largest deficit of any G20 country during the pandemic, and by a wide margin.

Canada’s government deficit has ballooned by the most of any major country during the COVID-19 pandemic by a wide margin ― but in the short run at least, that might be a good thing, a new report says. Canada’s deficit this year will amount to nearly one-fifth (19.6 per cent) of the country’s economic output, according to an analysis at National Bank Financial. That’s well ahead of the second-place United Kingdom, which is on track for a deficit equal to 14.6 per cent of its economy.

The federal government’s deficit is headed for $330 billion this fiscal year, the Parliamentary Budget Office says. “Put more positively, this also implies that no other country has provided as much fiscal support for the economic recovery as Canada has,” NBF economists Warren Lovely, Taylor Schleich and Jocelyn Paquet wrote in a report this week. “We’re already seeing some benefits here. The recovery in Canada’s labour market by nearly all measurements has been much stronger than in the U.S., where fiscal uncertainty and inaction has provided a headwind in recent months.” Again today, October 17, people across the country are awaking to reeling images of violence and racism carried out against Mi’kmaq fishers. Many people are asking key questions such as why the RCMP has not pro-actively intervened and defended Mi’kmaq leadership and fishers, what are the economic realities of the fisheries in Mi’kma’ki, and what conservation considerations are at play.

There are a lot of moving parts to the conflict that is ongoing in St. Mary’s Bay, Nova Scotia: It is a highly-charged situation, borne out of generations of colonialism, decades of government mishandling and neglect, and months of growing racially-motivated tensions.

But one element not commonly mentioned in the news is the corporate influence on the fishing industry by Clearwater Lobster, a major offshore fishing company headed by CEO John Risley.

Facts about Clearwater

Clearwater Lobster is fishing on unceded, unsurrendered, stolen lands and waters of the Mi’kmaq Nation. Over the last 40 years, governments have favoured corporate fishing operations like Clearwater over small-scale owner-operators and Mi’kmaq fishers. Both the federal and provincial governments have given the company special treatment:

Clearwater made its own management plan for Lobster Fishing Area 41 (LFA 41) in the 1980s. The company also wrote its own fisheries management plan, conducts its own scientific research (and keeps the results private because it’s “proprietary”), and co-chairs the management board for LFA 41.

Clearwater is subject to extremely minimal outside fisheries observation. Only four per cent of its catch is reported on.

The company owns all eight lobster fishing licences in LFA 41 (though recently sold some to Membertou First Nation). This kind of consolidation isn’t allowed in any other fishing area, and no other company or person has done it.

Clearwater uses one huge fishing boat to fish LFA 41. This boat has 6,500 traps, where an owner-operator commercial boat would have up to 400 and a Mi’kmaq moderate livelihood boat would have 50.

It is practically impossible for Clearwater to drop and collect its traps within 72 hours, which is the required time limit. In January 2019, we learned that Clearwater has been fishing illegally for years, leaving traps for way longer than is allowed, causing unknown harm to lobster and other species, including endangered cod and cusk.

Clearwater fishes year-round, while Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) regulated owner-operators fish only in a set season.

Between 2014 and 2018, Clearwater received more than $4.7 million in loans from the federal and provincial governments, both repayable and non-repayable.

Clearwater not only fishes huge quantities of lobster (1.6 million pounds per year) but also has a near monopoly on arctic surf clams.

Clearwater CEO John Risley is the richest person in Nova Scotia. He owns several other enterprises beyond Clearwater, including Ocean Nutrition, which makes dietary supplements, and Cable and Wireless Communications, which operates in the Caribbean and Central America.

Neoliberalism versus Mi’kmaq rights

The conflict in St. Mary’s Bay is an archetypal clash between a colonial state and an Indigenous nation. In this case, the Mi’kmaq Nation is working to assert its rights on its unceded, though occupied, territories. Meanwhile, the Canadian Government and its precursors have demonstrated their interest in controlling and extracting natural resources. In early settlement days, those resources were lands, fish, pelts, timber, and more; today, they expand into metals, diamonds, fossil fuels and yes, lobster. Canada consistently tries to maintain control over these resources so it can have some control over how power and wealth are distributed. The chosen economic strategy of the Canadian government is neoliberalism – using state power as a tool to extract resources and create private wealth.

This is a very different approach to natural resources than what is being put forward under the ‘moderate livelihood fishery’— a term seen throughout the current media coverage. With a moderate livelihood fishery the idea isn’t to get rich – the idea is use natural resources responsibly to enable people to live a decent life. This is the Mi’kmaq principle of Netukulimk: to “use of the natural bounty provided by the Creator” sufficient to ensure “the self-support of the individual and the community.” Read more about Netukulimk here.

In stark contrast, a colonial government’s neoliberal approach to managing fisheries, the easiest way to extract wealth from the fishery is to integrate and streamline management as much as possible. That’s what’s happened with Clearwater over the last 40 years. One company is far easier to negotiate with and regulate than several thousand small-scale fishers.

The facts about Clearwater listed above are not well known by the general public, which works to the advantage of both Clearwater and the governments by allowing Clearwater to operate to keep those facts under the radar.

What does this have to do with the conflict in St. Mary’s Bay?

In a complicated situation like this one, who benefits from the chaos? Clearly Mi’kmaq fishers are not benefiting from the violence being enacted upon them and the 20 years of government inaction on the 1999 Marshall Supreme Court decision. While it is settler fishers who are perpetrating the vandalism and violence that is occurring, they’re not benefiting from this conflict either. Their livelihoods have been put at risk by DFO mismanagement of the fishery as well.

Inshore lobster fishers have fought against Clearwater and the consolidation of the inshore fishery for a long time. Clearwater would love to control the inshore fishery, but that would mean the end to owner-operator fishing, and would mean an end to fishing communities like those around St. Mary’s Bay. The inshore fishery is the last small-scale fishery and Clearwater is trying to seize control.

Watch this two-part short documentary by Martha Steigman and Sherry Pictou: The End of the Line, focusing on the struggle of small-scale settler fishers in the Bay of Fundy, and In Defense of our Treaties, which follows members of Bear River First Nation as they try to protect their treaty rights to fish from DFO pressure.

Clearwater and both levels of Canadian government benefit from the long delay in action on the Marshall Decision because they have not had to relinquish any control over the fishery during that time, and have been able to consolidate power and access to wealth through LFA 41. Additionally, the level of confusion and unrest surrounding the conflict in St. Mary’s Bay provides a distraction from this consolidation and lack of action on Mi’kmaq rights.

It is critical that we stand with Mi’kmaq fishers trying to exercise their treaty rights (which were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1999), and that we call on the federal government to live up to the rulings of its own Supreme Court. We should not lose focus of the fact that Mi’kmaq people are being subjected to serious intimidation, threats of violence and property damage at all hours of the day and night in St. Mary’s Bay. While we hold that in our minds and hearts, we can also recognize that the violence and vandalism is a convenient cover for the web of corporate-friendly, neoliberal policies that the federal government has been creating for decades.

On conservation

Amid this conflict, question and statements about the need to conserve lobster stocks have come up. There is lots that can be said about conservation, and one contribution to this conversation we can make is this: small-scale fisheries can provide food and livelihoods for communities while protecting the integrity of the environment. It is hard to imagine how consolidation and massive Clearwater-type fishing can be sustainable – 4,600 traps at a time in sensitive deep-water ecosystems, leaving traps in the water for so long that many animals get stuck inside and die. These are the kinds of fishing practices that conservation groups tell consumers about to get them to avoid purchasing the products.

By pushing towards this large-scale corporate model of fishing and refusing to contend with treaty rights for more than 20 years, the federal government is putting Mi’kmaw lives at risk, forcing settler fishers into a corner, and permitting Clearwater’s pillaging of the ocean – the very one the federal government is claiming to protect.

Canada’s legal marijuana industry is celebrating a jump in sales, more brick-and-mortar stores and competitive pricing as it celebrates two years in business.

Since Canada legalized recreational marijuana on Oct. 17, 2018, legal sellers and producers have struggled to compete with the black market, but there have been recent gains in the licensed industry.

The change? The coronavirus pandemic, says retail marketing expert David Soberman.

“It’s been a boon for the legal industry,” said Soberman, a professor of marketing at the University of Toronto.

In July, licensed marijuana stores sold more than $231 million in product — a 15-per cent increase from June’s sales — marking the biggest monthly jump since the country legalized cannabis.

“Because people are spending more time at home, they’re perhaps more comfortable with consuming cannabis,” said Terry Kulaga, the founder of Weed Me, a legal cannabis production company based in Pickering, Ont.

“As people work from home, they probably have more time to actually consume cannabis.”

Canadians have been buying more pot, according to Statistics Canada, and where people are buying it is changing.

The long-established black market has always had more business than the Canadian pot industry, but households have been spending more on the legal cannabis market and less on the illegal market.

Statistics Canada data shows that compared to April-June 2019, people spent 74 per cent more money on licensed cannabis during the same period this year, which is just after the World Health Organization declared a coronavirus pandemic in March. The decrease in spending on the black market in the same time frame is less than five per cent.

“There’s been a downturn in the black market because people are much more reluctant to go out and meet their regular cannabis dealer in the way that they were prior to the pandemic,” said Soberman.

Another reason Canadians have been spending more on legal pot is Canada is seeing more licensed retail stores pop up. Ontario, which is Canada’s biggest market by population, opened zero brick-and-mortar stores come legalization day.

Now, the province has more than 180 licensed cannabis stores and growing — the province recently greenlit opening 40 stores per month, which is double what it did before, says the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, which is responsible for regulating Ontario’s marijuana retail stores.

“More and more people are having a shop open up locally where they can access a safe and reliable product,” said Kulaga, whose business provides cannabis to provinces across Canada.

“Moreover, I’ll mention that inside of the stores themselves, the people selling the product are becoming more knowledgeable about the product and the suppliers.”

Steven Fry runs Sessions Cannabis, a chain of five stores across Ontario, and he says he’ll have 35 more stores built and ready to open before the new year.

It will take time for the legal market to completely overtake the illicit market, Fry says.

“Legal cannabis is infinitely better than illegal cannabis,” said Fry. “It’s a healthy and safe product that’s approved by Health Canada … it is highly regulated. Tax money is going back to the community when we’re purchasing through the legal channels.“

The legal market can now boast cheaper prices. When Canada first legalized recreational marijuana, the average price per gram for legal pot was $10.25 while in the illegal market, it was around four dollars less.

The Ontario Cannabis Store released a pricing comparison showing more recent prices: near the beginning of the year, the average price per gram for legal dried flower on its site was $7.05, including taxes, which is almost a whole dollar cheaper than the cost of cannabis on sale through illegal mail-order sites: $7.98.

Soon after Canada legalized recreational cannabis, “people had complained about not only the price but the quality” of licensed products, said Kulaga.

“What we’re seeing is, as the more [legal] growers come online, you’re getting a better product. You’re getting more product. As a result, you’re getting some economies of scale.”

Soberman says the customers who’ve been loyal to the legal marijuana market throughout the pandemic will stick with it.

“Even once the pandemic is over and we have a vaccine, you’re going to find that people have become accustomed to buying their pot legally. And it will be a while before the black market is able to recapture perhaps a larger fraction of what it used to sell.”
