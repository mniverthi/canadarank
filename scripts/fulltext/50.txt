OTTAWA—If Chinese Ambassador Cong Peiwu intended his news conference marking the 50th anniversary of Canada’s renewal of diplomatic relations with China to be part of a charm offensive, or a reminder of the two countries’ longstanding friendship, it backfired.

Spectacularly.

Instead, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau contemplates a long-promised re-set of his Liberal government’s approach to China, he got a clear reminder Thursday of why the Chinese ruling party and its officials are not that interested in what Canada thinks, but very interested in what Canada does.

In an hour-long virtual news conference, Cong escalated Beijing’s war of words with Canada Thursday.

Beijing’s envoy explicitly warned Ottawa not to offer political asylum to Hong Kong dissidents at risk of emboldening “violent criminals” and endangering the safety of Canadian citizens and business people in Hong Kong. “So, if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and prosperity in Hong Kong and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong, you should support those efforts … to make sure the one country, two systems is most definitely and comprehensively implemented in Hong Kong.”

When asked if that was a threat, he said, “That’s your interpretation.”

The ambassador also warned “forceful measures,” such as China has taken against the U.S., could be pursued if Ottawa dared to censure China’s ruling party over what it denies are human rights violations against the largely Muslim Uighur minority group in Xinjiang province. It wasn’t clear what measures he meant.

Cong’s bottom line? What China’s ruling party does in Hong Kong and Xinjiang are not matters of “human rights,” but “national security” and purely “internal affairs,” said Cong.

None of Canada’s business.

Late Thursday, Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne replied from Brussels: “The reported comments by the Chinese Ambassador are totally unacceptable and disturbing. I have instructed Global Affairs to call the Ambassador in to make clear in no uncertain terms that Canada will always stand up for human rights and the rights of Canadians around the world.”

For the Conservative Opposition, for Hong Kong democracy advocates, for human rights activists demanding accountability from China, even for some Liberal MPs, it showed Ottawa needs to take tougher actions … whether it’s banning Huawei from Canada’s 5G networks, offering residency or citizenship to Hong Kong dissidents, or cracking down on those who harass and intimidate Chinese-Canadians or members of the Chinese diaspora here in Canada.

Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong rejected the ambassador’s remarks. So did Liberal MP John McKay, chairman of Canada’s public safety committee.

“They essentially kidnapped two of our citizens,” said McKay. “They pay no attention to any elements of the rule of law, trade agreements, they use things like canola as political leverage and they sow mischief in the diaspora communities. I just think it’s time for a big re-think, and a big re-set,” said McKay.

The Conservative Opposition has long called on the Liberal government to take a harder line on China, and to create an expedited path for residency and citizenship for those fleeing Hong Kong.

Chong said Canada has a clear interest and obligation to speak up “against China’s increasing belligerence” because of the 300,000 Canadian citizens in Hong Kong, China’s violation of its international treaty commitments to respect Hong Kong freedoms under the agreement with Britain at the 1997 handover, and because it was Canadian soldiers who died defending Hong Kong, “not the People’s Liberation Army.”

Chong urged the Trudeau government to not just ban Huawei, but to come up with a consistent foreign policy to counter China’s influence here and abroad, to pursue sanctions with allies where warranted, and to review Hong Kong’s special status.

The ambassador would not comment on Canada’s upcoming policy re-set, nor on the Conservatives’ hardline view of China, saying he wouldn’t discuss domestic political matters.

When he was asked several questions about China’s treatment of two detained Canadian men, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, or the two Michaels, as they’ve come to be known in Canada, he gave no ground.

He objected to any suggestion the two Canadian detainees had been mistreated. News reports last year said Kovrig’s glasses were confiscated and the men were in cells that were lit around the clock. Chrystia Freeland, then-foreign affairs minister, said they faced “very difficult” conditions even after solitary confinement ended.

Cong called those “groundless accusations” and “lies” and said COVID-19 was the “only reason” for the 10-month denial of consular access to Canadian embassy officials.

Karim Lebhour, a spokesman for International Crisis Group, where Kovrig worked as a researcher while on leave from the Canadian government, dismissed Cong’s claims the pandemic prevented any consular contact.

“The fact that Michael’s first consular visit in 10 months was held virtually is proof enough that the pandemic is not an obstacle to the respect of his basic rights. Michael Kovrig, or Michael Spavor, should not be used as pawns in a diplomatic dispute between China and Canada.”

Cong insisted that wasn’t happening: “There is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side,” he said. The only obstacle to re-establishing strong relations between Canada and China, Cong said repeatedly, was the continuing detention of Meng Wanzhou, whom he said should be released immediately and allowed “safe return” to China.

In arresting and detaining her, Canada is acting as an “accomplice” of the United States, which, he said, is trying to undermine Huawei and Chinese high tech companies globally.

On Tuesday, Trudeau said he would continue to work with China to advance “Canadian interests and Canadian producers,” but he remained “absolutely committed” to working with allies to make sure China realizes “coercive diplomacy” and “arbitrary detention” cannot be a “successful tactic.”

Trudeau said Kovrig and Spavor’s detentions have put “a significant strain on Canada-China relations” and said he’d continue to push for the protection of “human rights in places like Hong Kong, in Xinjiang province with the Uyghurs.”

So now what?

The long-awaited policy re-set is not ready. Nor are any immigration measures to help Hong Kong dissidents. Both are said to be works in progress.

The Meng case is plodding through a Canadian court while she challenges her Dec. 1, 2018 arrest as unconstitutional.

Days after that arrest, Kovrig and Spavor were arbitrarily detained under unspecified allegations of endangering China’s national security.

The ambassador noted many “prominent” Canadians have called on Trudeau’s government to release Meng.

When he was asked if Kovrig and Spavor would be released if the Meng extradition case fails in a Canadian court, Cong said the Chinese judicial authorities are handling their case “independently.”

Meanwhile, Ottawa is staring down an increasingly aggressive Chinese government under President Xi Jinping.

Cong was blunt, saying the central ruling authorities are “countering terrorism” in Hong Kong and in Xinjiang province.

Critics such as Cherie Wong, of the democracy advocacy group Alliance Canada Hong Kong, interpreted Cong’s remarks as “definitely a threat, not only to the Government of Canada, but also to the Hong Kongers who have been advocating in favour of accepting political asylum seekers in Canada.

“This type of response is matching the same type of coercive diplomacy of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party). So while the comments are not diplomatic, it is reflective of how the CCP engages in international relations as a global partner.”

International human rights advocates, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have protested China’s repression of the Uighur minority in Xinjiang province, and the harassment of Uighur citizens abroad.

Chong said China’s actions in Xinjiang amount to “a cultural genocide.

“What the Chinese government is doing is wiping out an entire culture that has existed for a very long time.”

Many credible reports have been produced in the past year showing “widespread gross human rights violations,” including one last month by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which documented the widespread erasure of Uighur cultural and religious heritage, he said.

Cong denied “genocide” is taking place in Xinjiang, and said that Western countries should “be careful” when they use the term genocide.

During Tuesday's debate, the leaders were asked to explain how they've reckoned with their own privileged positions as white people.

In one of the most talked about moments of the night, NDP Leader John Horgan spoke of playing lacrosse with Indigenous young people and suggested, "I did not see colour."

June Francis, co-chair of the Hogan's Alley Society board of directors, described that answer as "stunning" in light of this summer's protests over anti-Black racism, and said it demonstrates the depth of Horgan's privilege.

"It means that he can walk through the world and never confront racism," she told CBC.

WATCH | NDP Leader John Horgan says he regrets hurting people with comments:

NDP Leader John Horgan apologizes for race comment made during debate 1:03 John Horgan says he regrets saying he didn't see colour growing up on Vancouver Island when asked about how he's reckoning with his white privilege. Horgan says he's promising to do better in the future. 1:03

Francis said that as premier, it was Horgan's job to govern on behalf of everyone who lives in B.C., and if he's blind to race, he's also blind to the systemic racism that many British Columbians live with.

Horgan apologized for his comment immediately after the debate, calling it inappropriate and saying, "I'll never fully understand, as a white person, the lived reality of systemic racism. I'm listening, learning and I'll keep working every day to do better."

This is the answer I wish I gave on stage. Saying "I don’t see colour" causes pain and makes people feel unseen. I’m sorry. I’ll never fully understand, as a white person, the lived reality of systemic racism. I’m listening, learning, and I’ll keep working every day to do better. <a href="https://t.co/Rbr7h0JOyh">pic.twitter.com/Rbr7h0JOyh</a> —@jjhorgan

But for Genevieve Fuji Johnson, a political science professor at Simon Fraser University, that apology suggests Horgan still doesn't quite understand the issue.

"So often, colour blindness is synonymous for words like neutral and fair, and to make the suggestion that beliefs and behaviours and laws and policies and institutions are neutral or fair just totally glosses over the myriad of forms of oppression and indeed violence that racialized people and minorities face at the hands of supposedly neutral laws and institutions," she said.

Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson's answer to the same question was also troubling for some of those who watched the debate. In his response, the Liberal leader told a story about working as a doctor and delivering an Indigenous baby who was later named after him.

Francis said Wilkinson's answer didn't show any engagement with the issues that Indigenous people face in B.C.

"Instead, he told this story about himself and how glorious his experience was," she said. "It was deeply troubling, actually."

Wilkinson expanded on his comments Wednesday at a campaign stop in Kitimat, on B.C.'s North Coast.



"In medical practice, I became very much aware of the particular struggles of Indigenous people in dealing with the health-care system and in dealing with society's other structures,'' Wilkinson said. "The idea that people in our society are somehow treated differently because of the colour of their skin or where they grew up or who their parents are is not acceptable.''

He said he grew up fortunate as a white male and it wasn't until his teenage years that he realized he received different treatment than others.



"It's wrong. It's not fair,'' said Wilkinson. "I've suggested in the [Liberal] platform there should be anti-racism training for everybody in the provincial government.''

Green Party Leader Sonia Furstenau's response during the debate earned praise from some corners. Furstenau acknowledged the existence of systemic racism in the criminal justice system.

"We aren't all equal. I wish we were, but we're not," she said.

Francis said that answer was "fantastic" but that she remains concerned about the lack of diversity among Green Party candidates.

Fuji Johnson, on the other hand, said Furstenau missed an opportunity to discuss how systemic racism is pervasive in all Canadian institutions, from health care to education.

"I gave her a C, maybe a C+. I would say her response was adequate," Fuji Johnson said.

Indigenous issues missing from debate

Meanwhile, there were some other concerns about the debate's lack of focus on issues that matter to Indigenous communities.

CBC journalist Wawmeesh Hamilton pointed out that the only mention of reconciliation came during discussion of energy projects.

"I began to wonder, with no mention of it, if we reconciled. ... Did I miss something?" he said.

There was also nothing about the unique concerns of urban Indigenous people, who represent the majority of the Indigenous population in B.C.

In a similar vein, the Coalition on Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls in B.C. released an open letter Wednesday expressing "grave concern and disappointment" that none of the parties have released plans to implement the Calls for Justice of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.

Hamilton argued that the debate should have had an entire section devoted to the question of reconciliation. But as he noted, no Indigenous journalists were included on the panel that drafted questions for the party leaders.

"A step back was taken where reconciliation and Indigenous issues were concerned," he said. "Some soul searching needs to be done, stock should be taken and corrections need to be made."

You can read more stories here.In September, adherents to the far-reaching and baseless QAnon conspiracy ⁠— which falsely alleges the world is controlled by a Satanic cabal of pedophiles who are plotting against U.S. President Donald Trump ⁠— joined anti-mask and anti-vaccine protests in Montreal and Vancouver.

In July, a heavily armed military reservist from Manitoba who had posted memes on Instagram about the QAnon conspiracy rammed his truck through the gates of Rideau Hall . Minutes away from Parliament Hill, Rideau Hall is the official residence of Canada’s Governor General, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s temporary residence is on its grounds.

This is the third of a series of stories Emma McIntosh is writing as part of National Observer's special coverage of the U.S. election. Read the second story here .

QAnon started in October 2017, named after an anonymous poster going by “Q” on the far-right message board site 4chan who claimed to be a high-level government official with details on a secret war. Spiralling off an earlier conspiracy theory called Pizzagate, Q’s messages started as elaborate and far-fetched defences of Trump. But broader themes in QAnon ⁠— the idea that an embattled minority of people who know “the truth” are fighting back against elites and corrupt politicians ⁠— have caught on worldwide, spreading to mainstream social media platforms.

“There’s something unique about QAnon,” said Amarnath Amarasingam , an associate professor at Queen’s University and associate fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization, who co-authored a recent report on QAnon for the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.

The unfortunate cultural import from the United States has been kicking around Canada for years, though violent incidents with links to the conspiracy theory are still relatively rare. But QAnon has gained new prevalence here amid COVID-19 and the American presidential election, which presents a peculiar set of problems, experts say.

On Oct. 4, a political candidate in Saskatchewan resigned after clicking “like” on social media posts supporting QAnon. And a group of people that includes QAnon believers remains camped out on Parliament Hill after making headlines last month for attempting to place NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh under a “citizen’s arrest.”

“Our greatest responsibility is keeping Canadians safe. To fulfil that responsibility, our government and agencies must keep pace with evolving threats and global trends, such as the growing concerns of ideologically motivated violent extremism or the dissemination of hate speech,” said Mary-Liz Power, a press secretary for Blair, in a statement.

When asked by Canada’s National Observer whether the scenarios it’s considering involve violence carried out by QAnon supporters, the Prime Minister’s Office directed questions to the office of Public Safety Minister Bill Blair.

Last week, Trudeau said the Canadian government is readying itself for possible “ disruptions ” following the Nov. 3 vote.

“You might actually see some people engage in more violence,” he said.

However, Amarasingam is more concerned, arguing that the conspiracy has the potential to eventually become more of a threat. An election loss for Trump, for example, could be seen as an urgent call to action for QAnon supporters, he added.

“It’s an issue that merits watching, but it’s not the thing that’s going to bring down civilization as we know it,” said Phil Gurski, a former senior strategic analyst at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the president and CEO of Borealis Threat and Risk Consulting , whose specialty is typically Islamist extremism.

So far at least, the conspiracy appears to be far less prevalent north of the U.S. border. And although the FBI has designated QAnon a domestic terror threat in the U.S., Canadian authorities have so far made no such distinction here.

Canada, along with the United Kingdom and Australia, is one of the top countries producing QAnon content besides the U.S., according to a July report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a global think tank that studies extremism.

In a statement, NDP public safety critic Jack Harris said the government should be “vigilant” in assessing risk levels and in asking social media companies to act.

The Conservative Party of Canada declined to comment on whether the government should be doing more about QAnon.

“Canadians can be confident that our security agencies have the skills and resources necessary to detect, investigate and respond to both criminal and national security threats.”

“The government should be very clear with social media platforms that they have a responsibility to ensure that their platforms aren’t being used as a tool to spread dangerous and baseless conspiracy theories,” Harris said.

QAnon activity has increased amid COVID-19, U.S. election

For many of its followers, QAnon has proved to be addictive. In thousands of posts, or “Q Drops,” since the original in 2017, the anonymous person or people behind QAnon have left vague messages for the reader to interpret.

In general, the idea ⁠— however unsubstantiated and untethered to reality ⁠— is that Trump is fighting a secret war against a Satanic cabal of pedophiles, members of the global elite, who run a global child-trafficking network. The conspiracy also alleges that an ever-growing number of celebrities and politicians are involved, including former presidential candidate and first lady Hillary Clinton, and even high-profile Canadians like Trudeau.

It’s the type of conspiracy that thrives in the disinformation-rich environment created by Trump, Gurski said. Though it sounds as silly as conspiracies from decades past ⁠— think Area 51 or the moon landing ⁠— some people have stopped laughing, he added.

“They have suspended their powers of analysis, they have suspended their powers of critical thought, and they are taking it as true,” he said. “They are taking it as a call to action.”

The fact that followers must interpret Q’s hazy messages to attempt to understand them creates an almost religious element, said Amarasingam. People who “translate” the posts can gather large followings on social media, with information eventually circulating from darker corners of the internet to mainstream platforms where it reaches a wider audience.

“In a way, QAnon supporters have become like prophets … interpreting a sacred text,” he said.

The so-called Q drops are also cryptic enough that international audiences can find whatever meaning they want. For example, Vice documented attempts to fit the murders of Toronto billionaires Barry and Honey Sherman into the conspiracy in 2018.

The real power of QAnon, however, comes from the moral outrage inherent to its core ideas.

“If you truly believe that the world functions a certain way, that there are actually children being enslaved, the response would be the same for all of us,” Amarasingam said. “They come to accept a reality that would mobilize any of us. It’s just that we’re not seeing the same reality.”

This has spawned several serious incidents in the real world. In 2018, for example, a 30-year-old man from Nevada blocked off a bridge during a 90-minute standoff with police, four guns and 900 rounds of ammunition in his car. He was arrested without incident, and in letters to senior government officials after the fact, he used a QAnon slogan. In 2019, a 24-year-old from New York said in court that QAnon drove him to kill a mob boss.

In Canada, there has been one similar incident: that of the Manitoba reservist who crashed his truck through the gates of Rideau Hall. It’s not clear how much QAnon may have influenced the incident, but the fact that the man had shared two QAnon-related posts on social media did indicate he had dipped his toes in the waters of the conspiracy theory.

Not too many QAnon sightings over this past week, but here are some from Alberta and Saskatchewan.



More #YellowVestCanada rallies are scheduled for tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/URGY8LdVW0 — Michael Bueckert (@mbueckert) January 5, 2019

In the U.S., the conspiracy has also driven dozens of congressional candidates to run for office this fall.

“It’s become this political-social movement,” Amarasingam said. “Because they have Trump on the inside, they feel like they can join him in the struggle and burn it all down from the inside.”

We haven’t seen anything on that level in Canada — the Saskatchewan candidate, for example, has denied being associated with QAnon and said “liking” posts isn’t equivalent to being a follower.

But QAnon still appears to be growing in North America and beyond. The ISD Global report found “major spikes” in online QAnon activity in March.

Part of that is likely to be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which upended much of our normal lives, Amarasingam said. Not only were a ton of people at home and spending more time in front of a computer than usual, but many had also been thrown into uncertain economic circumstances. Lack of social trust and an uprooting of norms have both historically been risk factors that make people more susceptible to conspiracy or extremist movements, he added.

“A lot of people’s response to (COVID-19) was … a sense of chaos,” he said. “A lot of what we thought we knew, we didn’t believe in anymore.”

In times of trouble, many people tend to look for someone to blame, former CSIS analyst Gurski said. A polarized election in the U.S. and rising levels of hate make it a “perfect storm,” he added.

“We’re already in an environment where a lot of people are afraid, they’re upset, they’re angry, at either real or perceived lack of action by their government when it comes to COVID, when it comes to the economy, and the U.S. election.”

The ISD Global report also pointed to the Nov. 3 U.S. election as an important factor. Researchers have said they believe Russian-backed organizations are attempting to amplify QAnon content online in the run-up to the vote, seeing it as an opportunity to sow division in the U.S.

The FBI has identified QAnon as a domestic terror threat. “The FBI assesses these conspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace, occasionally driving both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts,” the agency said in a memo first reported by Yahoo News. Those incidents may increase as the election draws nearer, the document noted.

The view from Canada is different.

“The RCMP is aware of this movement, however, the RCMP does not investigate movements or organizations for their ideological dispositions,” RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Caroline Duval said in an emailed statement to Canada’s National Observer.

“We investigate criminal activities by those who threaten the safety and security of Canadians.”

Gurski said he wouldn’t disagree with the RCMP’s view and that he believes QAnon hasn’t yet reached a level of critical momentum in Canada the way it has in the U.S. The Rideau Hall incident is just one example, and the public doesn’t have a lot of information about what led to it, he added.

Though QAnon exists here, it hasn’t reached the same proportions as it has south of the border. Canada also lacks open-carry gun laws that exist in many U.S. states, which make for a more dangerous set of circumstances, he added.

“I would argue … (QAnon) wouldn’t be high on the list (of priorities) right now,” Gurski said of QAnon. “Could it change? Absolutely.”

How do you stop an online conspiracy movement?

It’s very difficult to reason with QAnon adherents directly, Amarasingam said. “The same systems of expertise or knowledge that we turn to, to explain fact and fiction, they dismiss it in its entirety.”

It’s also difficult to identify them or count how many people are involved ⁠— in Canada and in the U.S., the movement has coalesced both online and in real life with other right-wing causes, meaning a lot of people dabble in it without fully going along, said Barbara Perry, director of the Centre on Hate, Bias and Extremism at Ontario Tech University. It’s now linked to broader white supremacist, anti-Semitic, anti-authority and anti-vaccine movements, and it’s easy for people to passively participate in a low-risk way by “liking” and “sharing” content.

“It’s a little bit of cherry-picking going on in terms of people jumping in and out of conspiracy platforms ... taking on the pieces that seem to help them make sense of their lives,” Perry said.

For example, QAnon supporters joined with another far-right group called the Yellow Vests in 2019 protests in Ottawa, Perry said. And QAnon believers are part of a fringe group that has camped out on Parliament Hill since Canada Day, which attempted last month to execute a “citizen’s arrest” on several people and accosted federal NDP Leader Singh. On Facebook, Perry said, QAnon content has often been buried among other right-wing causes.

“As it goes internationally, you may see more of that,” Amarasingam said of QAnon blending with other far-right ideologies. It needs to adapt and align with other movements to keep gaining momentum, he added.

It’s also important to remember that most people who believe in QAnon will never become violent, Gurski said.

No one has really figured out how to stop fringe conspiracy theories, especially once they hit the mainstream. But past studies of extremist movements give us an idea of where to start.

Priority one: Booting QAnon off major social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

“It has become just as problematic as when ISIS was thriving on Twitter and Facebook in 2013 and 2014,” Amarasingam said.

Platforms have now started to do just that. Twitter took steps to limit QAnon content in July, and Facebook initiated a crackdown this month that saw top QAnon influencers deleted there and on Instagram. One top QAnon influencer in Quebec who disseminated COVID-19 conspiracy theories to tens of thousands of followers was kicked off Facebook in that sweep.

Extremely dedicated QAnon believers will likely attempt to regroup, both on the same platforms and others that may inhabit darker corners of the internet, Amarasingam said.

“They just kind of chase their tail for a while. That’s generally a good thing,” he said, adding that it’s better they spend time making new accounts than spreading their messages.

Removing them from the biggest platforms can also limit the number of people who see conspiracy content ⁠— your unsuspecting grandma, for example, is unlikely to seek out Q drops on 4chan, but might unwittingly encounter QAnon posts shared by Facebook friends who didn’t realize what they were disseminating.

Though conspiracy theories always have hardcore believers, the people they want to win over are the “mushy middle” who aren’t firm adherents but might uncritically accept portions of it, Perry said.

In some ways, the “genie is out of the bottle” already, Perry said. People can easily switch up their language and find ways to get around restrictions on platforms, and conspiracy movements can use the crackdowns to lend credibility to complaints that their movement is being silenced.

Amarasingam said so far, crackdown efforts appear to be making a difference, cutting out some of the most prominent QAnon voices and groups. But whether the changes will work in the long term is unclear — social media platforms must stay vigilant to prevent conspiracy theorists from regrouping, he added.

“It’s really a question of sustained pressure,” he said.

An added challenge, he said, is that QAnon believers tend to be middle-aged or older. In the past, anti-extremism programming has been aimed at men in their 20s who are vulnerable to some types of radicalization ⁠— strategies used there likely won’t work on older people, he added.

“We haven’t actually thought about what that looks like, to try to help old people,” he said.

Of course, the outcome of the presidential election is also likely to have an impact on what happens next. A Trump victory could legitimize the movement, Amarasingam said. But a Trump loss ⁠— which polling indicates is more likely ⁠— could also galvanize it, depending on whether the president commits to a peaceful transfer of power.

Gurski said it’s likely that CSIS and the RCMP are watching the issue.

“If there’s any indication that it might be veering towards violence, it would be taken seriously ⁠— if, and this is a big if, the resources are available,” he said. “Those resources have to be taken from somewhere.”

In an interview with Canada’s National Observer editor-in-chief Linda Solomon Wood last week, former CSIS director Richard Fadden called for a royal commission on the problem of disinformation. And although Canadians are quick to dismiss extremism at home as the work of a “couple nutbars,” he added, the country could benefit from open conversations about such problems.

“I don't mean to exaggerate, but democracy is not going to work unless people are able to compromise, dialogue and talk. It seems to me, there's rather less of that,” Fadden said.

Governments could also think bigger, Perry said. Older people are influenced by their peers, much like any other age group , so could labour movements and employers, for example, be mobilized to help?

Perry also said governments could look at legislation aimed at stopping disinformation, and even take steps to redefine terrorism.

“We really have to get to the adults,” she said. “They’re more set in their ways ... We’ve got to find ways to disrupt that.”
