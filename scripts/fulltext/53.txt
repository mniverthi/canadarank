QUEBEC — The new leader of the Parti Québécois on Thursday criticized the Legault government’s decision to provide additional funding to anglophone post-secondary institutions in Montreal, arguing that too little is being done to defend the French language.

“The Quebec government, the CAQ, is investing $750 million to expand Dawson, expand McGill University, and thus accelerate an already present phenomenon of anglicization of students,” Paul St-Pierre Plamondon said.

Despite the fact there are more francophones and allophones than anglophones in Montreal, English CEGEP students will outnumber French CEGEP students in the city by next year, he asserted. St-Pierre Plamondon wants the number of English students to be equivalent to their percentage of the population.

“We need to address this to make it proportionate,” he said.

The actions of the ruling Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ), which purports to be a nationalist party that defends the French language against creeping anglicization, have failed to match their words, St-Pierre Plamondon added.
