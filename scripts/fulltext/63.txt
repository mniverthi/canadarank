Bonjour mes amis,

Plusieurs usagers dans les derniers mois et dans le recensement ont exprimé leur désir d’avoir accès à une plateforme pour pratiquer leurs habiletés en français et les améliorer davantage. Dans cet esprit, nous accueillerons les « vendredis français ». Ce seront des fils punaisés tous les vendredis dans le but particulier de pratiquer, de lire et d’écrire en français. Nous espérons identifier un thème de départ pour lancer la discussion, mais toute discussion en français est bienvenue dans le fil.

Les règles de ce fil sont plutôt simples :

Toutes les règles habituelles du sous-reddit sont toujours en vigueur Essayez d’écrire en français autant que possible, même si votre français est cassé Évitez les discussions de nature politique pour garder l’objectif des conversations à propos de l’utilisation de la langue, et idéalement pas de façon argumentative.

Les francophones de langue maternelle et les apprenants potentiels sont encouragés à se joindre à la discussion et à favoriser les apprentissages. Plus tard, nous travaillerons à créer un insigne pour ceux qui facilitent ces discussions pour les y identifier.

Ce n’est pas l’endroit pour remettre en question le rôle du français dans la société, du gouvernement ou de la politique canadienne ou pour attaquer les communautés francophones. Le français est parlé par des Canadiens d’un bout à l’autre de notre grand pays et l’intention est ici d’encourager les utilisateurs à développer leurs habiletés linguistiques.

Vous pouvez bien sûr visiter r/quebec, r/french, r/learnfrench, r/francophonie, r/francaiscanadien ou r/france pour continuer votre apprentissage tous les jours de la semaine. Il y a aussi un salon Discord disponible pour apprendre le français. Vous pouvez aussi en profiter pour proposer des thèmes pour les semaines à venir. Si vous avez des questions, sentez-vous bien à l’aise de les poser dans cette chaîne de commentaires, ou d’envoyer un message à la modération.

Bonjour mes amis,

Many users over the past few months and in the census have expressed interest in a platform in which to practice their French language skills and develop them further. In that spirit, we will be hosting "French Fridays". This will consist of a stickied thread each Friday for the express purpose of practicing, reading and writing in French. We will aim to identify a starting theme to initiate a discussion, but the post is welcome to any discussion in French.

The rules of this thread are fairly straight forward:

All subreddit rules are still in effect Try to post using as much French as possible, even if your French is broken Try to avoid discussions political in nature to keep the conversations focused on the use of the language and ideally not argumentative.

Native French speakers as well as prospective learners are encouraged to join into the discussion and encourage learning. Moving forward we will be working to develop a flair for those who facilitate or are assisting in these discussions to identify them within these discussions.

This is not the forum to discuss the role of French in Canadian society, government, politics, or attack French communities. French is spoken by Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and the intent of this is to encourage users to develop their language skills. You can, of course, visit r/quebec, r/french, r/learnfrench, r/francophonie, r/francaiscanadien, or r/france to go on learning on any day of the week. There is also a Discord chatroom available for learning french.

If you have questions, please feel free to make them within this comment chain, or to message the moderators. James Hobson's lightsaber is not a toy.

The YouTuber and his team at Hacksmith Industries in Kitchener, Ont., have created a hyper-realistic, retractable plasma lightsaber that reaches a scorching heat of 2,200 C.

"That's above the melting point of most metals," Hobson told As It Happens host Carol Off. "It's pretty dangerous."

Hobson and his team unveiled the prototype on their YouTube channel Hacksmith last week. They plan to release a second video Thursday in which they'll use the lightsaber to cut through metal siding, a Stormtrooper mannequin and a steel plate "similar to a bank vault door."

The lightsaber looks stunningly similar to the ones made famous in the Star Wars universe. And just like the iconic Jedi sword, the blade is a plasma beam that can retract and extend at the touch of a button.

That beam is generated with liquid propane gas and oxygen gas "mixed in a really fancy laminar flow gas nozzle" — a technology used to control the flow of water in jumping fountains.

"The beam is very straight and narrow, whereas if you were to just light propane on fire, you're going to get a flamethrower effect, like you'd see inside of a barbecue," Hobson said.

"But because we're using this very fancy laminar flow nozzle, we're able to get the solid-looking beam of white-hot fire, basically."

By adding different salts to the plasma, Hobson can change the beam's colour. For example, boric acid will make a green beam like Yoda's lightsaber, sodium chloride produces a bright yellow like Rey's, and strontium chloride will generate a bright red for those who prefer to walk on the dark side.

But unlike the Star Wars version, Hobson's isn't 100-per-cent mobile. It comes with an external power pack worn on the back, Ghostbusters style.

"Even with all our new equipment and capabilities here at Hacksmith Industries, we're still bound by the laws of thermodynamics," Hobson explains in the video.

"We don't exactly have D-size batteries capable of putting out more power than a nuclear power plant — which by the way, is what you'd need for a lightsaber to function like it does in the movies."

This isn't the team's first crack at a lightsaber, nor their first replica of science-fiction technology.

The whole point of the Hacksmith YouTube Channel is to replicate fictional objects using real-world technology and engineering. Previous creations include Iron Man's helmet, Captain America's shield, Batman's grappling hook and Inspector Gadget's helicopter hat.

"It's literally our bread and butter. It's what we come to work to do every day, Hobson said. "And obviously, lightsabers are one of the most famous and most popular sci-fi technologies in the world."

Hobson, who has a bachelor's degree in mechanical systems engineering, quit his previous job in 2015 to dedicate himself to Hacksmith Industries. In that time, the company has grown into a team of 14 employees, and a YouTube channel with 10.2 million subscribers.

The idea, he says, is to inspire young people to take interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

"Because we've been doing it so long, we've gotten comments now, like: 'I went to engineering school because of your videos, and now I've graduated and now I'm working as an engineer.' And it's really rewarding to hear stuff like that," Hobson said.

But these are not the kind of projects you can try at home, he said — and the prototypes are not for sale.

"It's not about teaching them how to do what we're doing," Hobson said. "It's showing them what's possible through engineering. It's bringing your wildest ideas to life."
