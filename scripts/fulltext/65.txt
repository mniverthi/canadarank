The Liberals argue they’ve already handed over plenty, and the opposition is simply on a fishing expedition to try to keep the scandal going. So the Liberals are responding with the only arrow in their quiver: a filibuster.

By late Thursday, both committees finished talking for the day without resolution, when Bloc Quebecois MPs joined Liberals in voting to pause.

It amounts to a game of parliamentary chicken, as each side must decide how committed they are to either delaying or forcing the vote.

“I’m saying if it takes all night, if it takes all week, we will be here until the Liberals stop obstructing, stop interfering with work of Parliament, and allow us to do our jobs as parliamentarians so we can get on with dealing with the many, many other issues that are facing Canadians,” said NDP MP Charlie Angus at the outset of Thursday’s ethics committee meeting.

“I’ve heard from members of the committee that this is Ottawa bubble, this isn’t what people want us to focus on,” said Conservative MP Michael Barrett. “Well, I can tell you, folks of any political stripe don’t like corruption, and they don’t like cover-ups. And that’s what this is.”

In the finance committee, meanwhile, the proceedings occasionally descended into farce. Liberal MP Peter Fragiskatos complained that Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre had turned his computer camera off; NDP MP Peter Julian said there’s no rule against turning off your camera; Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen then compared Poilievre to the cartoon character Polkaroo, earning a rebuke from the committee chair. It went on like this all afternoon.
