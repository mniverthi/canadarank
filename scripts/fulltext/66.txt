Trikafta, made by U.S. company Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is a breakthrough treatment for cystic fibrosis. But Vertex has yet to submit the treatment to Health Canada for approval, which means it is not available to patients living here. In the U.S., it costs more than $300,000 per patient per year.

Health Minister Patty Hajdu was asked about the drug in question period last week and said the government has contacted the company to encourage it to bring the drug to Canada.

“We have reached out to the corporation to ask it to apply. We have assured it that we will expedite the review of Trikafta.”
