Adams said the government is attempting several reforms at once and it should be taking it one step at a time. He said some or all of the reforms might reduce prices, but they might also limit access and by applying all the reforms at the same time, it will be impossible to tell which are working.

“The concern is that patients will be hurt as collateral damage, as the government seems to be trying to do too many things at the same time.”

He said he worries about the early signs that drug companies will walk away from Canada because the prices will be set too low.

“I won’t say it’s a big red flashing light. I will say it’s an amber flashing light.”

Why would you perform research and development here for a drug that you were thinking, well, I'm not going to get to a price that is sustainable

Trikafta, made by U.S. company Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is a breakthrough treatment for cystic fibrosis. But Vertex has yet to submit the treatment to Health Canada for approval, which means it is not available to patients living here. In the U.S., it costs more than $300,000 per patient per year.

Health Minister Patty Hajdu was asked about the drug in question period last week and said the government has contacted the company to encourage it to bring the drug to Canada.

“We have reached out to the corporation to ask it to apply. We have assured it that we will expedite the review of Trikafta.”

Hajdu has defended the changes the government is set to implement, arguing they will save Canadians billions.

The changes have received support from Canadians worried about the rising cost of drugs, with more than 2,000 people signing a petition submitted in the House of Commons calling on the government to move ahead with the new rules. The Canadian government is sticking to its ambitious plans for bringing newcomers into the country, even as its borders remain essentially closed.

Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino is leaning against scaling back the government’s immigration targets for the coming years, according to two people familiar with the matter. That includes bringing in 351,000 new permanent residents in 2021 -- the most in a century. The government will update its three-year projections within the next month.

Since coming to power in 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government has sought to accelerate immigration, a policy that before COVID-19 struck had helped drive the fastest pace of population growth in three decades. Sticking to that policy could be a challenge.

Fewer Newcomers

Current travel restrictions and borders closures have sapped the flow of people into Canada. A high unemployment rate that looks likely to persist, and the fact Trudeau’s minority government must rely on support from opposition political parties to pass legislation, pose additional challenges.

In March, Mendicino unveiled a plan to increase immigration over the next three years -- targeting 341,000 permanent residents in 2020, 351,000 in 2021, and 361,000 in 2022.

So far, the 2020 numbers aren’t even close.

COVID Fears

Between January and August, Canada admitted 128,430 permanent residents. If the flow returns to 2019 levels, that number will rise to 240,000, or about 70 per cent of the target, according to Andrew Agopsowicz, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada. But even that may be optimistic.

It “may be possible if people have been delaying their move to Canada,” Agopsowicz said by email. “Of course, increased fears of a Covid resurgence may impact these plans.”

A similar trend has emerged in study permits as well, as international students have largely been unable to travel to Canada.

The decline in immigration is having significant knock-on effects in the housing market. For example, the vacancy rate for rental apartments in the Toronto area surpassed two per cent for the first time in 10 years, according to third-quarter data from research firm Urbanation Inc. Condominium rental listings doubled in the period and average monthly rents dropped more than nine per cent, the firm reported.

Mendicino’s office has consulted with various business, labor and settlement organizations to gauge the current demand for immigration. The minister is expected to announce the new targets by Nov. 1, which is the deadline for the department to present its plans before Parliament.The Canadian government is sticking to its ambitious plans for bringing newcomers into the country, even as its borders remain essentially closed.

As such, the Bank is announcing changes to the Bankers’ Acceptance Purchase Facility (BAPF), the Canada Mortgage Bond Purchase Program (CMBP) , and the extended Term Repo operations.

The Bank will discontinue the BAPF with the last operation scheduled for October 26, 2020. Similarly, the Bank will discontinue the CMBP with the last operations scheduled for the week of October 26, 2020.

Effective on October 21, 2020 the Bank will reduce the frequency of its Term Repo operations from weekly to bi-weekly. As such, the subsequent Term Repo operation will be conducted on November 3, 2020. The exact date and terms will be announced prior to each operation. In addition, effective immediately, the eligible securities for regular Term Repo operations will include only Canadian dollar-denominated marketable securities that are directly-issued or explicitly guaranteed by the Government of Canada or by a Canadian provincial government and that are eligible for the Standing Liquidity Facility. Own-name covered bonds, own-name Term ABS and own-name ABCP will no longer be eligible (Terms & Conditions).

The Bank will continue to monitor market conditions and, if warranted, may further revise its programs, including making changes to the size and maturity tranches of the term repo operations.

The Bank remains committed to providing liquidity as required to support the functioning of the Canadian financial system. Any discontinued facilities can be restarted if necessary.
