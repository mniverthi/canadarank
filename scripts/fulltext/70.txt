Liberal MPs are continuing to filibuster two House of Commons committees to avoid voting on motions that would reopen the investigation of the WE Charity scandal.

If adopted, motions before both the finance and ethics committees would request documents related to the WE Charity affair.

A filibuster is a political procedure where one or more members of Parliament debate over a proposed piece of legislation so as to delay or entirely prevent a decision being made on the proposal.

The WE Charity controversy came to light this summer after the Trudeau government outsourced the $500-million Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG) — a program to pay students for volunteering — to WE Charity, an organization with which his family, and that of then-finance minister Bill Morneau, had close financial ties for years.

Conservative MP Michael Barrett, who introduced a motion currently under debate in the ethics committee, said the hours the Liberals have spent filibustering and supporting the government’s “cover-up” of the WE controversy isn’t yielding the results Canadians deserve.

“It’s certainly high time for this to come to a vote,” he said Thursday as debate reached its third hour, adding that he expects hours more of debate on the motion.

Barrett’s motion would allow the committee to obtain a record of all speaking appearances since 2008 by Trudeau, his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, his mother, Margaret Trudeau, and his brother, Alexandre Trudeau.

The documents also include any fees and reimbursements, and the name of the company that booked the appearances. Barrett asked that the documents be forwarded to the clerk of the committee within 24 hours of the motion’s adoption, and that they be reviewed in camera (behind closed doors).

A similar motion was brought before the ethics committee in July, when Liberal MPs spent nearly four hours filibustering debate before the clock ran out to vote on the motion. The motion eventually passed on July 22 with all Liberal MPs voting against it.

New Democrat MP Charlie Angus said on Thursday that he didn’t understand the Liberals’ “obstruction” of Barrett’s motion, because it had already been passed in July. The documents ordered in July ultimately didn’t flow to committee members, because the probe was halted when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prorogued Parliament in August.

“We will be here until the Liberals stop obstructing,” Angus told committee members.

Opposition members sought to bring the motion to a vote around 4:30 p.m., but Liberal MP Han Dong said there was still quite an extensive speaker’s list of committee members who wished to discuss the motion.

Liberal MP Patricia Lattanzio said the members need all the answers and information before they can make a decision on the motion.

Thursday’s meeting was the committee’s third debating Barrett’s motion. The meeting began shortly after 2:30 p.m. in Ottawa and did not adjourn until almost 11 p.m., after over eight hours of debate.

The House finance committee meeting also dragged on through Thursday, in which members discussed a motion from Conservative MP and committee vice-chair, Pierre Poilievre.

The motion, which was introduced last week on a point of privilege, would allow finance committee members to gain access to previously pre-redacted documents related to the WE Charity scandal.

One of the last acts of Parliament that Trudeau allowed before he ordered it prorogued was for 5,000 pages of documents to be distributed to members of the finance committee. The documents, which contained correspondence about the Liberal government’s decision to grant WE Charity the CSSG, were released with some pages already blacked out.

In a letter obtained by iPolitics, Philippe Dufresne, the law clerk and parliamentary counsel for the House of Commons, said the Commons and its committees are the appropriate authority to determine acceptable reasons for withholding the documents.

“As my office has not been given the opportunity to see the un-redacted documents, we are not able to confirm whether those redactions are consistent with the order of the committee,” he wrote to committee clerk David Gagnon in a letter dated Aug. 18.

Poilievre’s motion seeks to give the committee access to the un-redacted version of the documents between the government and WE Charity — or from senior officials to cabinet ministers regarding the CSSG from March 2020 — which were first ordered by the committee in the previous session on July 7. If adopted, the documents would then be sent the House law clerk who would be responsible for redactions.

Mark Kennedy, a spokesman for government House leader Pablo Rodriguez, said the finance committee should get to hear from the public servants who did the redactions, as well as the law clerk and parliamentary counsel.

“What the opposition is doing is finding officials to have breached privileges of Parliament without even providing them the due process to explain themselves,” he said in an emailed statement. “Due process is important to us.”

The committee, Kennedy said, can take whatever action it deems necessary if it’s still unsatisfied after hearing from the witnesses.

Liberal MPs on the finance committee have so far refused to vote on Poilievre’s motion, and instead spent the meeting arguing that the motion should not have been introduced on a point of privilege. They also said the committee should instead be discussing a motion to begin pre-budget consultations, on which Canadians would prefer it spends its time.

Liberal MP Julie Dzerowicz said this could all be avoided if the Conservatives pulled their motion and agreed to begin pre-budget consultations.

The committee meeting began at 11 a.m. on Thursday. It finally adjourned at 10:17 p.m., after 11 hours of debate, with the support of all Liberal MPs on the committee, and Bloc Québécois MP Gabriel Ste-Marie.

It was finance’s second meeting discussing the motion, and the committee will reconvene on Friday.

Earlier this week, Trudeau told reporters that the House investigations of WE Charity are “petty politics.”

“We have an awful lot of work to do, and we’re going to continue doing it,” he said Tuesday. “The opposition can focus on whatever it is they want. We will stay focused on Canadians.”

In August 2020, four terminally-ill patients were granted permission to use psychedelic therapy in Canada. They were given psilocybin, the hallucinogenic component of what are popularly called “magic mushrooms,” to ease their anxieties and depression towards the end of their lives.

So how does psychedelic therapy work, and why is it being used for end-of-life care?

Psilocybin is just one type of psychedelic therapy that has piqued the interest of medical researchers since the 1950s. However, there has been a historical reluctance to adopt these therapies for mental health in end-of-life care, also known as palliative care.

End-of-life care involves helping someone remain comfortable, and physicians will use palliative practices to alleviate things like pain and shortness of breath, as well as provide support through death for patients with life-threatening conditions.

James Downar, MD, is a researcher and head of the palliative care division at the University of Ottawa. “To palliate is to cloak,” he explained in an interview with The Pigeon. “When we palliate a symptom, we are soothing or easing [it].”

Doctors choose this course of treatment when a condition is deemed unfixable. “There are times when you can’t actually fix the problem—but you may be able to reduce the effect it has on a person,” he said.

Downar explains that there are many kinds of suffering that may occur because of an incurable condition, including physical, mental, and existential.

According to Downar, existential distress occurs when a person is robbed of the ability to do the things that give their life purpose. When a person is given a terminal diagnosis, this feeling of loss takes on an air of permanence.

“You think to yourself, ‘Well I’m going to die, I know I’m going to die,’” he explained. “’The cause of my loss of purpose is permanent […] I’m basically just waiting out the rest of my time until a complication takes me away.’”

Existential suffering is where psychedelics hold the most potential for good, he said.

The challenge with existential suffering is that there is no reliable therapy to treat it. “People have tried a number of approaches,” he explains. “None of them have been all that effective.”

Psychedelics, often remembered as a cornerstone of 1960s counterculture, have been associated with the hippy movement, the Woodstock music festival, and the occult.

Outside of popular culture, however, psychedelics have undergone a long journey to be considered for use in palliative care. Researchers began investigating the therapeutic potential of the drugs as early as the 1950s, but that work was largely halted until recently.

In the recent cases of four terminally ill patients, they were prescribed psilocybin. However, psilocybin is just one of many substances that fall under the psychedelic umbrella. Others in this category include lysergic acid diethylamide, better known as LSD, and mescaline.

While each substance has a unique origin, they all have similar effects on the mind. When taken in high doses, they can have strong effects on a person’s perception of the world. Users might experience hallucinations and confused senses, such as hearing colours or seeing sounds. People can also experience what is commonly known as a “bad trip,” which can manifest as intense fear or paranoia.

These substances have also been known to induce rich, spiritual-like experiences. In the 1950s and early 1960s, users of psychedelics would often report feelings of connection, love, and compassion for others.

This was a big deal for early mental health researchers. Early advocates of the drugs, such as Canada-based Dr. Humphry Osmond and British science-fiction writer Aldous Huxley, were among the first to consider psychedelics as a treatment for mental health. Throughout the 1950s, the two men exchanged many letters on the topic, trying to understand how psychedelics affect the mind and how to leverage these drugs to treat conditions such as alcoholism.

At the time, Osmond was conducting LSD trials with his patients at the Weyburn Mental Hospital in Weyburn, Sask. Patients in these trials reported feeling stronger, more optimistic, and receptive to therapy. These feelings, the patients said, continued long after the hallucinogenic effects of the LSD wore off.

Huxley himself experimented with psychedelics as medical treatment. He would later write to Osmond about how the drugs helped him and his wife find peace as she succumbed to cancer. The experience was so profound that Huxley requested the same for his own death; he died with LSD in his veins in 1963.

Downar said the psychedelic experience is profound because it forces the user to undergo a process called ego dissolution.

“[This is] when the barrier between the self and the universe goes away,” he explained. “You essentially become one with the universe.”

He feels this experience of ego dissolution seems to be key to the effectiveness of psychedelic therapy for existential distress. When a person goes through this process, they can learn to adopt a new perspective on their life and their problems.

“The idea is that [your suffering] bothers you, but it’s not debilitating, crippling or making you want to end your life,” Downar explained.

In the context of end-of-life care, psychedelics can be used to reduce the sense of loss that causes existential distress, and are usually done with the help of a trained psychedelic therapist.

The user will sit comfortably in a room and they will be administered a large dose of a psychedelic like psilocybin. The therapist will then talk to them and help them explore their feelings.

The process lasts anywhere from six to eight hours, after which the ego dissolution wears off, but the lessons learned from the experience remain.

The problems with this method come down to expense and practicality, which is why it has taken so long for psychedelics to be taken seriously as a mental health therapy.

“You have to have a lot of therapists available at the drop of a hat,” said Downar. “We don’t really have that in Canada.”

In the absence of available therapists, micro-dosing was considered another potential treatment method for end-of-life patients.

In the 1950s, governments were looking for innovative ways to provide health care while reducing costs. Around the same time, over-the-counter prescriptions for anti-depressants or anti-anxiety pills were becoming a popular way to treat mental illnesses. People could receive treatment by taking their medications with no medical supervision required.

In a similar process, Downar said that micro-dosing psychedelics can help patients. Psychedelic micro-dosing involves having patients take sub-hallucinogenic amounts of the drug more frequently than they would higher dosages.

These micro-doses can be consumed at home and without the need for a trained therapist.

“The idea is that you can give people a prescription and they’ll get the same benefit as if they had six hours of therapy,” Downar explained.

However, micro-dosing still needs to be researched more thoroughly before it can be widely adopted.

Dr. Erika Dyck is a medical historian at the University of Saskatchewan and says that over-the-counter prescriptions are a useful fiscal solution to replace expensive in-person medical care.

Until recently, there hasn’t been an over-the-counter equivalent for psychedelics that could take the place of intense sessions with a trained therapist.

There also remain some cultural barriers to the acceptance of psychedelics as a viable therapy.

The history of psychedelics is a complicated one, Dyck explains.

“By 1962, there [was] the identification of a huge black market for LSD, and we started to see more and more teens freaking out, having bad effects.”

She says that newspapers at the time focused on these bad effects without acknowledging that the teens in question may have also been taking other substances.

“All of that doesn’t really matter when it becomes front-page headlines for years,” she explained.

By that point in time in Canada, LSD was categorized as a Schedule III narcotic, belonging to a category of drugs that were thought to pose the least amount of risk for abuse but were still illegal for non-research purposes.

Downar says that a stigma remains towards psychedelics in some parts of the palliative care community. He also explained that ketamine had a similar reputational problem before it became a common anaesthetic for surgeries.

With more research, Downar suggests that LSD might follow a similar path towards acceptance.

He has recently received funding to explore micro-dosing as a therapy for people in existential distress.

“For those of us who work in the business, this is a no-brainer,” he said. “We know how common these problems are and we know that we need the tools to be able to respond.”
