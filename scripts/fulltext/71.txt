The Chinese ambassador to Canada warned the Trudeau government today not to grant asylum to Hong Kong residents fleeing a widely criticized national security law imposed by Beijing.

"We strongly urge the Canadian side not (to) grant so-called political asylum to those violent criminals in Hong Kong," Ambassador Cong Peiwu said in a video press conference from the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa.

He said that would amount to "interference in China's domestic affairs, and certainly it will embolden those violent criminals."

Hong Kong was supposed to operate under a "one country, two systems" deal after Britain handed its former colony over to Beijing in 1997 under an international agreement. But human rights and pro-democracy advocates say Beijing's new national security law is undermining freedom in what is known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

"So if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes," Cong said.

Cong also flatly rejected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's assertion that China is engaging in coercive diplomacy by imprisoning two Canadian men in retaliation for the arrest of a Chinese high-tech executive on an American extradition warrant. Meng Wanzhou is living under house arrest in Vancouver while her case wends through a British Columbia court.

In December 2018, China imprisoned Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and charged them with undermining the country's national security. Cong said they are still undergoing a legal process in China but did not provide further details.

He repeated his government's demand that Canada release Meng immediately but insisted her case and his government's prosecution of Kovrig and Spavor are not linked.

"We will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China's approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them," Trudeau said earlier this week as the two countries marked 50 years of relations at one of the lowest points in Canada-China bilateral relations.

Cong said Canada's efforts to get other countries to join its fight for Kovrig and Spavor is "doomed to fail."

The European Union raised concerns about the two Canadians by name in the communique summarizing its recent summit with China.

"We oppose any remarks that interfere in our internal affairs. And I would like to point out, there is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side," Cong said. Liberal MP Han Dong went on at length about the government's anti-racism strategy

"The action of a multi-day filibuster by members of the government is a government-led coverup," Michael Barrett said.

OTTAWA — Two House of Commons committee meetings dragged on for hours Thursday as Liberal MPs continued to filibuster opposition efforts to reopen their investigations into the WE Charity affair.

The finance committee spent 11 hours debating amendments to a Conservative motion denouncing redactions to roughly 5,000 pages of documents released by the government in August — just as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prorogued Parliament, shutting down four separate committee investigations into the affair.

The ethics committee met for 10 hours, discussing a Conservative motion calling on Speakers’ Spotlight, the agency that arranged speaking engagements for Trudeau’s wife, mother and brother at WE events, to hand over 12 years of receipts for the trio’s paid appearances.

Both finished talking for the day without resolution, when Bloc Quebecois MPs joined Liberals in voting to pause.

“It just reminds me of the micro-aggressions that a lot of Canadians of colour face”

WE Charity, which was to have been paid $43.5 million to manage a now-defunct federal student volunteering program, has already disclosed that it paid Margaret and Alexandre Trudeau more than $350,000 over the years.

Trudeau’s wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, was paid a one-time fee of $1,400 for an event in 2012, before her husband became prime minister.

Liberal members of the ethics committee complained that the motion is too broad, a “fishing expedition” aimed at delving into the financial affairs of the prime minister’s relatives beyond their involvement with WE.

They also argued that it is wrong for MPs to investigate members of another MP’s family and that the matter should be left with the federal ethics commissioner, who is already investigating Trudeau and former finance minister Bill Morneau, who also had close family ties to WE.

In the process, they read portions of the Conflict of Interest Act into the record, recounted the history of the ethics committee and embarked on lengthy digressions on entirely unrelated matters.

Liberal MP Han Dong went on at length about the government’s anti-racism strategy, recounting anecdotes of Asian-Canadians who’ve been subjected to racism during the COVID-19 pandemic.

He argued the committee — which also deals with access to information and privacy issues — should be dealing with the impact of facial-recognition technology on people of colour rather than pursuing the WE affair, on which Trudeau, his chief of staff, Morneau, the clerk of the Privy Council and multiple other public servants have already testified.

“The action of a multi-day filibuster by members of the government is a government-led coverup”

After several opposition MPs interrupted to question the relevance of Dong’s digression to the motion before the committee, Liberal MP Greg Fergus, chair of the parliamentary Black caucus, intervened to suggest that the interruptions themselves were evidence of unconscious bias.

“The constant interruption … I know it’s not the intent of my honourable colleagues, but it just reminds me of the micro-aggressions that a lot of Canadians of colour face. I don’t hear other members being interrupted,” he said, urging them to allow Dong to continue speaking.

New Democrat MP Charlie Angus countered that if Liberals want to get on with a study of facial-recognition technology or anything else, they need only let the WE documents motion come to a vote and the committee could move on.

“I’ll go back to that a thousand times over the next 24 hours if I need to.”

“I’m asking him not to play games, not to throw these heavily loaded insinuations down at my colleagues,” Angus said. “If he wants to talk about something, just bring this to a vote so we can get this thing done.”

But neither the opposition members nor the Liberals showed any signs of backing down.

Indeed, Liberal MP Francesco Sorbara, who went on at length about how wrong he believes it is to violate the privacy of another MP’s mother and brother, said at one point: “I’ll go back to that a thousand times over the next 24 hours if I need to.”

Angus similarly declared: “If it takes all night, if it takes all week, we will be here until the Liberals stop obstructing, stop interfering with the work of Parliament, allow us to do our jobs as parliamentarians.”

Conservative MPs accused Liberal backbenchers of embarrassing themselves by participating in a coverup for Trudeau.

“The action of a multi-day filibuster by members of the government is a government-led coverup,” Michael Barrett said.

Thursday’s meeting was a continuation of a standoff that stalled the ethics committee for hours last week.

Similarly, the finance committee meeting was a continuation of a meeting from last week.

Because the clock officially continues to run when a meeting is suspended, in mid-afternoon Thursday the committee reached its 180th hour of considering an opposition effort to pry WE-related documents out of the government beyond those released in redacted form in August.

Much of that time was taken up with competing points of order raised mainly by Liberal members, but also questions by Conservatives about whether the Liberals’ points of order were really points of order and an attempt to challenge a ruling by Liberal committee chair Wayne Easter that the Prince Edward Island MP said couldn’t be challenged because it wasn’t a ruling.

Liberals Peter Fragiskatos and Julie Dzerowicz delved deeply into the redacted documents, pointing out numerous instances where the blacked-out material was civil servants’ phone numbers or codes for government conference-call lines.

Trudeau’s family ties to WE Charity plunged the student grant program into controversy the moment it was announced last June. WE pulled out within days and has since repaid all money advanced by the federal government to run the program.

Four committees, including the ethics and finance committees, had launched or were preparing to launch investigations into the affair when Trudeau prorogued Parliament, bringing all committee work to a halt.

Opposition parties are now trying to reopen their investigations at the finance and ethics committees, demanding documents that each committee had already asked for before prorogation. But the Conservatives, Bloc and NDP are all also proposing, in separate motions, to create a special committee that could take over the investigation.Liberal MP Han Dong went on at length about the government's anti-racism strategy

Spectacularly.

Instead, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau contemplates a long-promised re-set of his Liberal government’s approach to China, he got a clear reminder Thursday of why the Chinese ruling party and its officials are not that interested in what Canada thinks, but very interested in what Canada does.

In an hour-long virtual news conference, Cong escalated Beijing’s war of words with Canada Thursday.

Beijing’s envoy explicitly warned Ottawa not to offer political asylum to Hong Kong dissidents at risk of emboldening “violent criminals” and endangering the safety of Canadian citizens and business people in Hong Kong. “So, if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and prosperity in Hong Kong and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong, you should support those efforts … to make sure the one country, two systems is most definitely and comprehensively implemented in Hong Kong.”

When asked if that was a threat, he said, “That’s your interpretation.”

The ambassador also warned “forceful measures,” such as China has taken against the U.S., could be pursued if Ottawa dared to censure China’s ruling party over what it denies are human rights violations against the largely Muslim Uighur minority group in Xinjiang province. It wasn’t clear what measures he meant.

Cong’s bottom line? What China’s ruling party does in Hong Kong and Xinjiang are not matters of “human rights,” but “national security” and purely “internal affairs,” said Cong.

None of Canada’s business.

Late Thursday, Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne replied from Brussels: “The reported comments by the Chinese Ambassador are totally unacceptable and disturbing. I have instructed Global Affairs to call the Ambassador in to make clear in no uncertain terms that Canada will always stand up for human rights and the rights of Canadians around the world.”

For the Conservative Opposition, for Hong Kong democracy advocates, for human rights activists demanding accountability from China, even for some Liberal MPs, it showed Ottawa needs to take tougher actions … whether it’s banning Huawei from Canada’s 5G networks, offering residency or citizenship to Hong Kong dissidents, or cracking down on those who harass and intimidate Chinese-Canadians or members of the Chinese diaspora here in Canada.

Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong rejected the ambassador’s remarks. So did Liberal MP John McKay, chairman of Canada’s public safety committee.

“They essentially kidnapped two of our citizens,” said McKay. “They pay no attention to any elements of the rule of law, trade agreements, they use things like canola as political leverage and they sow mischief in the diaspora communities. I just think it’s time for a big re-think, and a big re-set,” said McKay.

The Conservative Opposition has long called on the Liberal government to take a harder line on China, and to create an expedited path for residency and citizenship for those fleeing Hong Kong.

Chong said Canada has a clear interest and obligation to speak up “against China’s increasing belligerence” because of the 300,000 Canadian citizens in Hong Kong, China’s violation of its international treaty commitments to respect Hong Kong freedoms under the agreement with Britain at the 1997 handover, and because it was Canadian soldiers who died defending Hong Kong, “not the People’s Liberation Army.”

Chong urged the Trudeau government to not just ban Huawei, but to come up with a consistent foreign policy to counter China’s influence here and abroad, to pursue sanctions with allies where warranted, and to review Hong Kong’s special status.

The ambassador would not comment on Canada’s upcoming policy re-set, nor on the Conservatives’ hardline view of China, saying he wouldn’t discuss domestic political matters.

When he was asked several questions about China’s treatment of two detained Canadian men, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, or the two Michaels, as they’ve come to be known in Canada, he gave no ground.

He objected to any suggestion the two Canadian detainees had been mistreated. News reports last year said Kovrig’s glasses were confiscated and the men were in cells that were lit around the clock. Chrystia Freeland, then-foreign affairs minister, said they faced “very difficult” conditions even after solitary confinement ended.

Cong called those “groundless accusations” and “lies” and said COVID-19 was the “only reason” for the 10-month denial of consular access to Canadian embassy officials.

Karim Lebhour, a spokesman for International Crisis Group, where Kovrig worked as a researcher while on leave from the Canadian government, dismissed Cong’s claims the pandemic prevented any consular contact.

“The fact that Michael’s first consular visit in 10 months was held virtually is proof enough that the pandemic is not an obstacle to the respect of his basic rights. Michael Kovrig, or Michael Spavor, should not be used as pawns in a diplomatic dispute between China and Canada.”

Cong insisted that wasn’t happening: “There is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side,” he said. The only obstacle to re-establishing strong relations between Canada and China, Cong said repeatedly, was the continuing detention of Meng Wanzhou, whom he said should be released immediately and allowed “safe return” to China.

In arresting and detaining her, Canada is acting as an “accomplice” of the United States, which, he said, is trying to undermine Huawei and Chinese high tech companies globally.

On Tuesday, Trudeau said he would continue to work with China to advance “Canadian interests and Canadian producers,” but he remained “absolutely committed” to working with allies to make sure China realizes “coercive diplomacy” and “arbitrary detention” cannot be a “successful tactic.”

Trudeau said Kovrig and Spavor’s detentions have put “a significant strain on Canada-China relations” and said he’d continue to push for the protection of “human rights in places like Hong Kong, in Xinjiang province with the Uyghurs.”

So now what?

The long-awaited policy re-set is not ready. Nor are any immigration measures to help Hong Kong dissidents. Both are said to be works in progress.

The Meng case is plodding through a Canadian court while she challenges her Dec. 1, 2018 arrest as unconstitutional.

Days after that arrest, Kovrig and Spavor were arbitrarily detained under unspecified allegations of endangering China’s national security.

The ambassador noted many “prominent” Canadians have called on Trudeau’s government to release Meng.

When he was asked if Kovrig and Spavor would be released if the Meng extradition case fails in a Canadian court, Cong said the Chinese judicial authorities are handling their case “independently.”

Meanwhile, Ottawa is staring down an increasingly aggressive Chinese government under President Xi Jinping.

Cong was blunt, saying the central ruling authorities are “countering terrorism” in Hong Kong and in Xinjiang province.

Critics such as Cherie Wong, of the democracy advocacy group Alliance Canada Hong Kong, interpreted Cong’s remarks as “definitely a threat, not only to the Government of Canada, but also to the Hong Kongers who have been advocating in favour of accepting political asylum seekers in Canada.

“This type of response is matching the same type of coercive diplomacy of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party). So while the comments are not diplomatic, it is reflective of how the CCP engages in international relations as a global partner.”

International human rights advocates, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have protested China’s repression of the Uighur minority in Xinjiang province, and the harassment of Uighur citizens abroad.

Chong said China’s actions in Xinjiang amount to “a cultural genocide.

“What the Chinese government is doing is wiping out an entire culture that has existed for a very long time.”

Many credible reports have been produced in the past year showing “widespread gross human rights violations,” including one last month by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which documented the widespread erasure of Uighur cultural and religious heritage, he said.

Cong denied “genocide” is taking place in Xinjiang, and said that Western countries should “be careful” when they use the term genocide.
