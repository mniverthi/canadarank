With less than 10 days to the provincial election, Chilliwack-Kent candidate Laurie Throness has stepped down from the B.C. Liberal Party after comparing free contraception to eugenics.

B.C. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson announced Throness was out during a campaign stop in Coquitlam, saying the opinions of the two-time MLA were not in keeping with party values.

"I've accepted his resignation ... we'll move forward without him," said Wilkinson. "It's critical that we all understand that access to contraception is a critical issue in our society."

Throness was elected in 2013 and again in 2017 but will now run as an independent, although with the Oct. 24 provincial election looming, the Liberal affiliation will still appear on the ballot beside his name.

According to Elections BC, write-in or mail-in ballots that have already been submitted with votes for the B.C. Liberal party or Throness in Chilliwack-Kent will count for Throness because the deadline to withdraw a party affiliation has already passed.

Updated numbers from Elections BC show that 7,385 mail-in voting packages have been issued in the riding.

Throness made his controversial comments Wednesday evening during an all-candidates forum. Both the NDP and Greens are campaigning on the promise of making prescription contraception more accessible.

"It contains a whiff of the old eugenics thing where, you know, poor people shouldn't have babies," he said.

"And so, we can't force them to have contraception, so we'll give it to them for free. And maybe they'll have fewer babies so there will be fewer poor people in the future. And to me, that contains an odour that I don't like."

The chair of Access B.C., a group campaigning for free prescription contraception, said Throness's comments were misogynistic and show how out of touch he is.

"I think the only way we can possibly even talk about [eugenics] is to jump in a time machine," said Teale Phelps Bondaroff.

"When you oppose actions that try and increase access to [contraception], especially in the way Mr. Throness did, you're basically saying women don't have the ability to make choices about things that happen to their body, and that's unacceptable."

Phelps Bondaroff said Access B.C. met with Throness in August of 2019 to discuss how increasing access to contraception leads to improvements in women's health and equality and saves governments money.

Laurie Throness’ comments on contraception are reprehensible. <br><br>The evidence is clear that improving access to contraception actually helps address inequality.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bcelxn2020?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bcelxn2020</a> —@SoniaFurstenau

Throness's comments were widely criticized on social media by members of all parties. On Twitter, B.C. Green Party leader Sonia Furstenau called what he said "reprehensible."

"The evidence is clear that improving access to contraception actually helps address inequality," she tweeted.

Eugenics is the practice of selective breeding in humans aimed at increasing so-called desirable characteristics while decreasing so-called undesirable traits.

Throness has been criticized in the past for alleged homophobia and for defending an article touting the widely discredited practice of conversion therapy. TORONTO -- An investigative technique widely used in the United States but still new to Canada helped police solve the murder of Christine Jessop, a nine-year-old girl who was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered 36 years ago.

Toronto police had a key piece of evidence -- a semen sample on Jessop’s underwear -- but until recently they didn’t have a DNA match. So they turned to the science of genetic genealogy, which combines DNA analysis and family tree research.

Genetic genealogy uses existing DNA data to provide a possible family tree from a human sample. Rather than one suspect, the approach digs up a broad family lineage, from parents and siblings to distant cousins. It’s then up to investigators to use classic investigative tools, such as combing through historical records, obituaries, social media or other channels to winnow their search.

In this case, Toronto police sent the DNA sample down to a laboratory in the United States, because there are currently no Canadian labs that specialize in genetic genealogy.

Staff Supt. Peter Code noted that, while the findings from the genetic genealogy test were not considered evidence, they helped investigators create two potential family trees.

“After extensively combing through detailed reports and documents, the second family tree produced Calvin Hoover,” Code said at a press conference on Thursday.

Hoover was 28 when he killed Jessop, police said, adding that he and his wife had a “neighbour acquaintance” relationship at the time of Jessop's death and that he may have worked with her father.

Hoover died five years ago.

Genetic genealogy is not widely used in Canada, but this case could change that, according to Sean Sparling, a former police chief in Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., and president of the Investigative Solutions Network.

“This is going to be a new emerging technology for Canadian law enforcement. You’re going to see a lot of cold case units where they have unsolved homicides, unsolved serial rapist cases, they’re going to be turning to this technology,” Sparling told CTV News Channel on Thursday.

In the United States, genetic genealogy has already helped crack several decades-old cold cases. Last year, forensic genealogists tracked down the identity of a woman killed near a Lake Tahoe hiking trail in 1982 and the identity of her killer.

In California, a man who was falsely accused of murdering a newspaper columnist and spent 14 years in prison was exonerated thanks to the technology. His case marked the second time in the U.S. that genetic genealogy helped prove someone innocent.

The work to finally track down Jessop’s killer involved “excellent police work,” said CTV News Public Safety Analyst Chris Lewis. But he said there are some lingering questions about how Toronto police accessed DNA information that led them to Hoover.

“The police just don’t have the DNA profiles of family members of suspects in their labs. Unless those people were charged with an offence that would require them to give a DNA sample, so somehow or another they’ve linked it through family members’ DNA, which may well have come from some private company like ancestry.com," he said.

The particulars of the case may never be fully known, Lewis said, because the case won’t head to trial.

“So there will never be a matter of it being tried and true and proven in court under that scrutiny. But it was enough for them to be able to close the file and give closure to the Jessop family,” he said.
