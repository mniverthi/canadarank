 OTTAWA—If Chinese Ambassador Cong Peiwu intended his news conference marking the 50th anniversary of Canada’s renewal of diplomatic relations with China to be part of a charm offensive, or a reminder of the two countries’ longstanding friendship, it backfired.

Spectacularly.

Instead, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau contemplates a long-promised re-set of his Liberal government’s approach to China, he got a clear reminder Thursday of why the Chinese ruling party and its officials are not that interested in what Canada thinks, but very interested in what Canada does.

In an hour-long virtual news conference, Cong escalated Beijing’s war of words with Canada Thursday.

Beijing’s envoy explicitly warned Ottawa not to offer political asylum to Hong Kong dissidents at risk of emboldening “violent criminals” and endangering the safety of Canadian citizens and business people in Hong Kong. “So, if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and prosperity in Hong Kong and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong, you should support those efforts … to make sure the one country, two systems is most definitely and comprehensively implemented in Hong Kong.”

When asked if that was a threat, he said, “That’s your interpretation.”

The ambassador also warned “forceful measures,” such as China has taken against the U.S., could be pursued if Ottawa dared to censure China’s ruling party over what it denies are human rights violations against the largely Muslim Uighur minority group in Xinjiang province. It wasn’t clear what measures he meant.

Cong’s bottom line? What China’s ruling party does in Hong Kong and Xinjiang are not matters of “human rights,” but “national security” and purely “internal affairs,” said Cong.

None of Canada’s business.

Late Thursday, Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne replied from Brussels: “The reported comments by the Chinese Ambassador are totally unacceptable and disturbing. I have instructed Global Affairs to call the Ambassador in to make clear in no uncertain terms that Canada will always stand up for human rights and the rights of Canadians around the world.”

For the Conservative Opposition, for Hong Kong democracy advocates, for human rights activists demanding accountability from China, even for some Liberal MPs, it showed Ottawa needs to take tougher actions … whether it’s banning Huawei from Canada’s 5G networks, offering residency or citizenship to Hong Kong dissidents, or cracking down on those who harass and intimidate Chinese-Canadians or members of the Chinese diaspora here in Canada.

Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong rejected the ambassador’s remarks. So did Liberal MP John McKay, chairman of Canada’s public safety committee.

“They essentially kidnapped two of our citizens,” said McKay. “They pay no attention to any elements of the rule of law, trade agreements, they use things like canola as political leverage and they sow mischief in the diaspora communities. I just think it’s time for a big re-think, and a big re-set,” said McKay.

The Conservative Opposition has long called on the Liberal government to take a harder line on China, and to create an expedited path for residency and citizenship for those fleeing Hong Kong.

Chong said Canada has a clear interest and obligation to speak up “against China’s increasing belligerence” because of the 300,000 Canadian citizens in Hong Kong, China’s violation of its international treaty commitments to respect Hong Kong freedoms under the agreement with Britain at the 1997 handover, and because it was Canadian soldiers who died defending Hong Kong, “not the People’s Liberation Army.”

Chong urged the Trudeau government to not just ban Huawei, but to come up with a consistent foreign policy to counter China’s influence here and abroad, to pursue sanctions with allies where warranted, and to review Hong Kong’s special status.

The ambassador would not comment on Canada’s upcoming policy re-set, nor on the Conservatives’ hardline view of China, saying he wouldn’t discuss domestic political matters.

When he was asked several questions about China’s treatment of two detained Canadian men, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, or the two Michaels, as they’ve come to be known in Canada, he gave no ground.

He objected to any suggestion the two Canadian detainees had been mistreated. News reports last year said Kovrig’s glasses were confiscated and the men were in cells that were lit around the clock. Chrystia Freeland, then-foreign affairs minister, said they faced “very difficult” conditions even after solitary confinement ended.

Cong called those “groundless accusations” and “lies” and said COVID-19 was the “only reason” for the 10-month denial of consular access to Canadian embassy officials.

Karim Lebhour, a spokesman for International Crisis Group, where Kovrig worked as a researcher while on leave from the Canadian government, dismissed Cong’s claims the pandemic prevented any consular contact.

“The fact that Michael’s first consular visit in 10 months was held virtually is proof enough that the pandemic is not an obstacle to the respect of his basic rights. Michael Kovrig, or Michael Spavor, should not be used as pawns in a diplomatic dispute between China and Canada.”

Cong insisted that wasn’t happening: “There is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side,” he said. The only obstacle to re-establishing strong relations between Canada and China, Cong said repeatedly, was the continuing detention of Meng Wanzhou, whom he said should be released immediately and allowed “safe return” to China.

In arresting and detaining her, Canada is acting as an “accomplice” of the United States, which, he said, is trying to undermine Huawei and Chinese high tech companies globally.

On Tuesday, Trudeau said he would continue to work with China to advance “Canadian interests and Canadian producers,” but he remained “absolutely committed” to working with allies to make sure China realizes “coercive diplomacy” and “arbitrary detention” cannot be a “successful tactic.”

Trudeau said Kovrig and Spavor’s detentions have put “a significant strain on Canada-China relations” and said he’d continue to push for the protection of “human rights in places like Hong Kong, in Xinjiang province with the Uyghurs.”

So now what?

The long-awaited policy re-set is not ready. Nor are any immigration measures to help Hong Kong dissidents. Both are said to be works in progress.

The Meng case is plodding through a Canadian court while she challenges her Dec. 1, 2018 arrest as unconstitutional.

Days after that arrest, Kovrig and Spavor were arbitrarily detained under unspecified allegations of endangering China’s national security.

The ambassador noted many “prominent” Canadians have called on Trudeau’s government to release Meng.

When he was asked if Kovrig and Spavor would be released if the Meng extradition case fails in a Canadian court, Cong said the Chinese judicial authorities are handling their case “independently.”

Meanwhile, Ottawa is staring down an increasingly aggressive Chinese government under President Xi Jinping.

Cong was blunt, saying the central ruling authorities are “countering terrorism” in Hong Kong and in Xinjiang province.

Critics such as Cherie Wong, of the democracy advocacy group Alliance Canada Hong Kong, interpreted Cong’s remarks as “definitely a threat, not only to the Government of Canada, but also to the Hong Kongers who have been advocating in favour of accepting political asylum seekers in Canada.

“This type of response is matching the same type of coercive diplomacy of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party). So while the comments are not diplomatic, it is reflective of how the CCP engages in international relations as a global partner.”

International human rights advocates, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have protested China’s repression of the Uighur minority in Xinjiang province, and the harassment of Uighur citizens abroad.

Chong said China’s actions in Xinjiang amount to “a cultural genocide.

“What the Chinese government is doing is wiping out an entire culture that has existed for a very long time.”

Many credible reports have been produced in the past year showing “widespread gross human rights violations,” including one last month by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which documented the widespread erasure of Uighur cultural and religious heritage, he said.

Cong denied “genocide” is taking place in Xinjiang, and said that Western countries should “be careful” when they use the term genocide.
