For years, rural communities in British Columbia hollowed out while the urban centres in the southwest corner of the province – especially Metro Vancouver – generated most of the province’s economic growth. Schools in rural resource towns closed for lack of students, because the opportunities for jobs were flowing to the city.

Now COVID-19 has turned that upside down.

The arrival of the pandemic early in the year led to massive job losses in every region of the province. But B.C.'s resource industries – forestry, mining, oil and gas – have since rebounded. The fortunes of Metro Vancouver have not. And for many businesses and workers in the province’s most densely populated region, there is stagnation, not recovery, on the horizon.

In the provincial election campaign now under way, voters are being asked to decide who can best manage the pandemic response. What they want to see from the parties will depend on where they live, because the path to recovery is different.





PATH FOR RECOVERY LOOKS DIFFERENT

In the middle of the sprawling complex of Vancouver International Airport, a major expansion project has been idled halfway through construction. It’s a visible sign of the changes COVID-19 has brought. YVR is at the heart of an air-transportation sector that was, until the start of the year, one of the engines of B.C.'s growth. In a normal year, it moves more than $10-billion through the economy, in both passengers and cargo. It is also a bellwether for the province’s large hospitality sector, which relies on tourism and business travel. When the travel bans and lockdown measures began in March, the terminals emptied. In April, traffic dropped off by 97 per cent compared with the same month in 2019. The airport authority does not expect to see a full recovery for years.

But in Quesnel, the forestry-dependent city in B.C.'s Interior, the economy is enjoying a boom. Not so long ago, the city of 10,000 was at the heart of a collapse in the forest industry. Today it is facing a rental-housing crisis as the population swells – a trend that has accelerated since the arrival of the pandemic in B.C. as people chase opportunities that now can be found in rural B.C. Employers are struggling to find enough workers – line cooks, nurses, hotel managers. Forestry mills are hiring again, with more than two dozen full-time jobs currently posted at West Fraser’s local operations. Homes are being snapped up at more than the asking price and contractors are running flat out to meet demand for renovations.

These two very different realities are being felt around the province. A recent report from the Business Council of B.C. found proportionally, Metro Vancouver has been harder hit by the virus-driven recession than other parts of the province.

“By region, Metro Vancouver experienced B.C.'s steepest job losses because of its industrial and employment mix. Consumer-facing industries have been hammered and have an over-sized presence in the Lower Mainland,” the Oct. 1 report found. Statistics Canada confirmed that trend on Friday, with new data showing employment in Metro Vancouver is 10.2 per cent below February levels, while outside of the metropolitan areas, employment in B.C. has increased by 2.6 per cent for the same period.

Tamara Vrooman is president and CEO of YVR. She made the decision to put construction of the new parkade on hold, leaving the airport with the equivalent of its front driveway ripped up. It had been launched in a period of growth – a record number of passengers moved through the airport in 2019. This year, she expects revenues will be down by 80 per cent over last year.

“The biggest challenge that we have is how to keep the sector functioning, so that we can maintain our staff and maintain our core operations, while we collectively deal with the pandemic until it’s safe to reopen and welcome that demand again,” she said. She is not speaking only of the airport and its major airlines, but of the many small companies – tourism operators and freight companies – that rely on this transport hub. The provincial government will have to play a role, she said, in building a bridge for this sector to make it to the other side.

Outside of those urban areas, the resource sectors have lifted B.C.'s communities back up. “Manufacturing, forestry, mining, oil and gas, and agriculture have regained all of the jobs lost since February – and then some. These industries are over-represented in non-metropolitan regions of B.C.,” the business council found.

Quesnel Mayor Bob Simpson is welcoming new residents who have left Metro Vancouver for the jobs, open spaces, and relatively cheap real estate. He said COVID-19 has accelerated a shift that started three years ago.

“We’re seeing some fundamental shifts in how people are living – they are realizing the big smoke isn’t where they want to be,” he said. But success brings its own challenges. “Our two pinch points as a community are, we don’t have the housing stock to accommodate the people who are moving in, and we don’t have the human resources to fill all the jobs.”





PROPOSED SOLUTIONS

British Columbia’s two main parties, the Liberals and the NDP, are offering different solutions to economic recovery, but both focus on provincewide solutions.

The Liberal platform includes a plan to eliminate the provincial sales tax for a year, with a reduced rate in the second year. That pledge would cost $10.8-billion in the first two years. They have also promised to permanently eliminate the 2-per-cent small business income tax, and to offer a loan-guarantee program for the province’s tourism and hospitality businesses.

Just days before the election was called, the NDP government announced a $2-billion pandemic recovery plan, which includes 55 programs – a mix of grants, training programs, and tax cuts. Business leaders have warned that the money is not yet flowing, and could come too late for some.

In the campaign, the NDP has focused on promises that would help people who work in the hard-hit service industry, including a cash payout of up to $1,000 for eligible British Columbians and a rent supplement. They are also offering more job training to help workers make the transition to in-demand jobs. Forecasters project that British Columbia’s economy, over all, will begin to recover in 2021. But the business council’s economist, Ken Peacock, said this won’t be spread out evenly and Metro Vancouver will be slower to recover.

“We fully expect more business failures here in the fall months and 2021,” he said. “They’ve been propped up by government funding, but as that winds up, and if we’re in a half-open situation in business and restaurants, there are going to be more bankruptcies," he said. "There’s so much lost revenue, and so many smaller businesses hurt. And that is going to weigh on this employment recovery process.”

Metro Vancouver shed 150,000 jobs this year. Earlier this month, the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade released the results of a survey showing its members fear the coming year will bring more bad news. One in four businesses do not expect to survive another year under the current economic conditions.

In this election, the board is asking the parties to commit to a series of changes that could soften the blow. They want more action on the availability and affordability of housing, more skills-training opportunities and faster access to programs that would help small and medium-sized businesses stay afloat.

ADVERSITY PROMPTS SEARCH FOR RESILIENCE

The town of Port McNeill, on the north end of Vancouver Island, bills itself as British Columbia’s forestry capital. It was only just starting to recover from a devastating strike that shut down the region’s forest operations for almost eight months, when the pandemic arrived. Tourism has suffered but, on the strength of a rebounding forest sector, new businesses are opening up. Mixed with that confidence, however, is some caution.

The experience of the pandemic has shaken things up, said Port McNeill Mayor Gaby Wickstrom. She wants her community to prepare for the future by pursuing a more diverse economy.

“I would like to see less forestry-reliant businesses. We could have anything, a call centre, a Kicking Horse coffee company," she said. “COVID smashed everybody’s boxes, and that allows people to look at our community in a new way, to be open to new way of doing things.”

Sign up today.Samuel L. Jackson's Enslaved describes itself as a series that "sheds new light on 400 years of human trafficking from Africa to the New World," but it's far from the only recent project focusing on the transatlantic slave trade.

In fact, it's not even the first this month.

The Ethan Hawke-led series The Good Lord Bird, which tells the story of abolitionist John Brown, premiered in early October. Filming wrapped on Barry Jenkins's upcoming series The Underground Railroad a week earlier, and the plantation-set horror film Antebellum came out in late August.

Still, Enslaved director Simcha Jacobovici says the reason he started the project, which looks at how the slave trade affected countries and people around the world, is because that history still isn't widely known. The population's understanding of these events are simplified and skewed, he said, and television could be a good way to fix that.

Samuel L. Jackson explores his roots in Gabon and is welcomed as a lost son by the Benga people. Watch Enslaved, Oct. 18 at 9 p.m. (9:30 NT) on CBC and <a href="https://twitter.com/cbcgem?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cbcgem</a>: <a href="https://t.co/SBk7PmvqMq">https://t.co/SBk7PmvqMq</a> <a href="https://t.co/rMLFsZeTYn">pic.twitter.com/rMLFsZeTYn</a> —@cbcdocs

"People, when they think of slavery — especially in North America — they think of the American South plantations, the American Civil War," Jacobovici said.

That's an issue, he said, as the impacts extend far beyond the United States. But as popular culture tries more and more to address the international tragedy that is the slave trade, it is still far from accurately portraying that history onscreen — especially when it comes to Canada.

Slavery onscreen

Whether slavery is comprehensively shown on screen matters for more than just ratings. Charmaine Nelson, a historian and professor at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, says for most people, knowledge about slavery begins with movies like Amistad, Roots and 12 Years a Slave. And due to a lack of inclusion in schools, that's usually where their education ends, Nelson says.

"Almost all of the big-budget Hollywood films that have been produced about slavery are about slavery in the tropics … or the American South," she said.

And when such project do touch on Canada's involvement, it's almost always in one way: as the end of the Underground Railroad, Nelson says. 12 Years a Slave features Brad Pitt as the Canadian opponent to slavery; Harriet casts the country as a utopian land of freedom.

Charmaine Nelson, a history professor and Canada Research Chair in Transatlantic Black Diasporic Art and Community Engagement, believes that while movies and television are a good way for people to engage with the history of slavery, much is being missed. (Submitted by Charles Michael)

It is a trope that Enslaved follows: in the episode of the docuseries that takes place in Canada, the show features abolitionists, sympathizers and a ship that ferried enslaved Black Americans to freedom.

That ignores the previous centuries where slavery was legal — and practiced — here, Nelson said. Though those stories are important and true, the Underground Railroad lasted for a relatively short time compared to a much darker history of slavery in Canada. And the emphasis on that period over the other means the majority of Canadians have no idea it ever existed here, she said.

"We've enshrined 30 years and painted ourselves as only good abolitionists who saved Black Americans," Nelson said. "And we've totally obliterated, ignored and tried to raze 200 years when we were also slaving."

That was true for Tanisha Campbell, a Bishop's University student who has pushed for more Black history in Canadian elementary and high school curricula. She said that she had never been taught about slavery in school, and so had to direct her learning herself as a teenager.

Even so, she only recently learned about the history of slavery in this country.

"I thought it was the place of sanctuary, salvation," Campbell said. "People fled the States to come here and were safe. I had no idea that Canada had any part in it."

Slavery in Canada

That 200-year history took place in a window prior to 1833, when the Slavery Abolition Act ended the practice in most British colonies, including Canada. Prior to that, the 1793 Act to Limit Slavery allowed any enslaved person who reached Upper Canada to gain their freedom.

Though that was the first legislation in a British colony to limit slavery, it recognized the practice as legal and socially acceptable. Britain had introduced legal protection to slavery in its colonies as a way to encourage settlement, and even those who were freed were often required to work as indentured servants.

Those are the stories Nelson said she is interested in studying. She was recently named Canada Research Chair in Transatlantic Black Diasporic Art and Community Engagement, and through that role is establishing the Institute for the Study of Canadian Slavery. Based in Halifax, it will be the first such research institute in the country.

Nelson is also one of the few academics to operate in that field. That, she explained, is part of the problem: due to so few researchers looking at slavery in Canada, very few detailed studies about it are on the books. She herself studies Canadian fugitive slave ads, which were advertisements printed by slave owners hunting for enslaved people who had escaped.

Nelson says she is one of only two people studying them, and began only a few years ago.

"This study of ads has been going on since the 1970s in the USA, Brazil and Jamaica," Nelson said. "Do you get me? We are 50 years behind other nations in some of these types of study."

That is important because, without the research, movies and shows like Enslaved won't be able to accurately portray that history. And without that portrayal, Nelson said, Canadians will continue to see certain events — such as the death of George Floyd — as something they're not.

"They think it's a 21st century or 20th century anomaly, and it's not," Nelson said. "When I see that, I see slavery."
