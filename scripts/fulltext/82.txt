Toronto police have identified the killer of nine-year-old Christine Jessop, who was abducted from Queensville, Ont., before being raped and killed in 1984 — a case that resulted in the years-long wrongful conviction of Guy Paul Morin.

Sources say Calvin Hoover, a Toronto man who was 28 years old at the time of Jessop's death, died by suicide.

Police did not confirm the cause of death at a news conference Thursday, saying only that Hoover died in 2015 and that there was no foul play.

Jessop was last seen on Oct. 3, 1984. Her body was found about three months later in a wooded area of Sunderland, Ont., about 56 kilometres from her rural home, on Dec. 31, 1984. Investigators say Jessop was stabbed to death.

Speaking to reporters, interim chief James Ramer said that on Oct. 9, 2020, police identified through DNA analysis the person whose semen was found in Jessop's underwear.

"Christine was described as a girl who loved life, her family, school and sports," Ramer said Thursday.

During the frantic search for the young girl, he said, "Her face was on every television set and in every newspaper."

"There are no winners in this announcement," said Ramer, adding the development is instead a "step forward" to bringing justice to Jessop's family.

Ramer said Hoover and his wife had a "neighbour acquaintance" relationship to the family at the time and that Hoover may have worked with Jessop's father.

The interim police chief said Hoover did have a "dated criminal record," but said it had no significance for the Jessop investigation and that Hoover had not previously been identified as a suspect.

Police are appealing for the public's help in filling in the timeline of Hoover's life from 1984 to 2015.

'Genetic genealogy' led police to Hoover

As for how Hoover was identified, Ramer explained that a DNA sample taken from evidence and sent to a lab in the U.S. that uses DNA technology not widely available to identify genetic markers eventually turned up Hoover's name through a process involving genetic genealogy.

Ontario's Centre for Forensic Sciences has a number of samples, some known and unknown, Ramer said.

The sample obtained from Jessop's underwear was an unknown sample. When Hoover's name was produced through the work of the U.S. lab, the centre, which happened to have a sample corresponding to Hoover, compared the two samples and found them to be a match.

Speaking to CBC News, David Mittleman, the CEO of that U.S. lab, Othram Inc., said unlike traditional forensics, which can identify approximately 20 genetic markers, the technology his lab uses can identify hundreds of thousands of markers that can help to identify very distant relatives.

"If you find enough of these distant genetic matches, you can use these matches in conjunction with family trees ... to triangulate where this DNA comes from and that can be used to find the identity of unknown victims, and in this case, an unknown perpetrator."

Reached at his home, Christine's father, Bob Jessop, said he felt "sickened" by the news. Jessop and Christine's mother, Janet, were both informed Thursday.

"As I get older you know you just start wondering when things are going to happen or if it's going to happen," he said. "Fortunately it's happened, but it's still a bit of a shock. Quite a bit of a shock, actually."

'The justice system failed me, but science saved me'

As for Morin, police went to his home Thursday personally to deliver the news.

"They said, 'We'll be brief, but we just want to apologize to you about what happened to you over the years. We have found the person responsible for Christine Jessop's murder," said Morin from his home.

Police would not tell him if it was a person he knew.

Morin, the family's neighbour, had been wrongfully convicted of the girl's killing before being cleared thanks to advancements in DNA technology. Morin was charged in 1984 and acquitted in 1986 before a new trial was ordered. He was found guilty, then successfully appealed his conviction in 1995.

Ontario's attorney general published a detailed report on the failings of Morin's conviction.

"I can say that I'm happy that there's closure for the Jessops' peace of mind," he said.

Morin said he felt relief that his name can now be definitively cleared.

"This is still an open active investigation, albeit with an incredible turn of events, but this positive identification is one very important answer. It has generated a number of new questions that our investigators are actively pursuing."

Speaking to CBC Radio's As It Happens on Thursday, the lawyer who represented Morin and helped him to successfully appeal his conviction said the development was welcome news.

"It's words I've been waiting to hear for 36 years," said James Lockyer.

"It's most unfortunate that the man isn't alive. I'd like to see him prosecuted."

He also said the case highlights another danger of wrongful convictions.

"The real culprit gets away with it. It's another effect that people often don't think of when you chase the wrong person."

News will bring relief to East Gwillimbury community, mayor says

Queensville, Ont., where Jessop lived, is a village in the Town of East Gwillimbury.

Speaking to CBC Toronto Thursday evening, East Gwillimbury Mayor Virginia Hackson said she thinks Thursday's news will bring relief to many in the community.

"I can tell you that many of the residents that lived in the town 36 years ago still live here today — it's one of those communities where people stay," Hackson said.

"Many people knew the Jessop family, many people knew Christine, and it was such a shock ... It was just such a tragedy in our community at that time."

Even though the killing took place decades ago, Hackson said knowing who was behind Jessop's death will "bring closure" to many people. Two hours after WestJet announced on Wednesday that it was curtailing its flights to and from Atlantic Canada, an email went out to all MPs and senators from Liberal MP Chris Bittle, parliamentary secretary to Transport Minister Marc Garneau.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on all aspects of the Canadian economy, but few industries have been more negatively impacted than the air sector," Bittle wrote in a letter first obtained by Radio-Canada.

"Many of you have reached out to us to share your thoughts about the current impact of COVID-19 on the air sector. At this stage, we would like to hear from all parliamentarians [on] what is required to support a robust air sector in Canada."

Last month's throne speech promised "further support for industries that have been the hardest hit, including travel," and the government's consultations on support for the air sector apparently were due to start this week.

While demands for government aid to the air travel sector have been building for months, WestJet's regional retreat will drive those demands to a new level.

For the federal government, the case for doing something to prop up airlines and airports might be stronger than the case for doing nothing. But even if the government wants — or needs — to intervene, it still has to work out a way to do so that it can defend politically.

Bubble trouble

P.E.I. Premier Dennis King was among those calling on the federal government to take action on Wednesday. But it's the region's own "Atlantic bubble" pandemic policy — which imposes registration requirements on travellers from outside of Atlantic Canada and compels them to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival in the region — that has caused the demand for flights in and out of the region to crater.

The Liberals probably don't want to be blamed if reductions in air service across the country become permanent. And sure enough, New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs told CBC's Power & Politics that he came away from a conversation with Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc on Wednesday with the impression that "something's going to happen" for the ailing industry.

The federal response to the pandemic has not ignored the country's largest companies. All businesses have been able to access the federal wage subsidy. In May, the Liberals rolled out a targeted loan program known as the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility (LEEFF).

WestJet has made use of the wage subsidy; Richard Bartrem, VP of marketing communications at WestJet, called it "terrifically helpful." WestJet has not sought assistance through the LEEFF program.

"The conditions that were placed [on] it just made it unwieldy in terms of our ability to recover from the pandemic," Bartrem said.

Critics have claimed LEEFF was rolled out too late and offers loans at terms less generous than what is available in the private sector. (When it was introduced, then-finance minister Bill Morneau called the program an option of "last resort" — so it might have been designed to not be popular.)

Only one company has been approved for a LEEFF loan to date, according to the federal government. Not long after the federal government announced that loan to Gateway Casinos (which operates 26 facilities across Canada), Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre was on his feet in the House of Commons ripping into the decision as an irresponsible use of public funds.

That's the risk a government takes whenever it offers help to specific firms or industries — even in the midst of a global economic crisis.

The nationalization route

Transport Minister Marc Garneau has had to fend off questions already about compelling airlines to refund customers for flights that were cancelled by the pandemic.

At the time, Garneau's stated reason for not forcing airlines to offer refunds seemed practical. Some struggling airlines might have collapsed completely if they were forced to pay back that money, he said. But if (or when) the federal government offers airlines support, the political conflict over refunds will come roaring back.

When Chrystia Freeland became finance minister in August, the National Airlines Council of Canada, which represents major carriers, wrote to her to outline a request for financial support in the form of "loans, loan guarantees or direct assistance." Airline unions have asked for $7 billion in federal loans.

The airlines also want "a national framework to ease interprovincial travel restrictions ... reciprocal border agreements with targeted safe countries" and the deployment of rapid COVID-19 testing.

Other countries have moved already to rescue their national carriers — in some cases through outright nationalization. The German government, for instance, now owns 20 per cent of Lufthansa. In Canada, any nationalization presumably would have to involve both Air Canada and WestJet.

LEEFF's limitations notwithstanding, the program's design suggests the government knew that it would have to justify and defend any effort to bail out a major corporate entity. LEEFF loan recipients have to abide by conditions that include restrictions on executive compensation and a requirement for climate-risk disclosure. Perhaps new conditions would help make loans for airlines more politically acceptable.

The political downside to bailouts

But even if the Trudeau government changed the terms of LEEFF to make it more industry-friendly, it still could be left to explain why the airline industry — or any other group of wounded firms — deserves special attention right now.

The Liberals have avoided taking a sector-specific approach to pandemic relief to date. If they start providing sector-specific assistance now, the floodgates will open — other sectors will demand the same assistance, or at least call on the Liberals to explain where they're drawing the line and why.

The government's throne speech specifically mentioned one avenue for assistance: supporting regional routes for airlines. "It is essential that Canadians have access to reliable and affordable regional air services," the speech said. "This is an issue of equity, of jobs, and of economic development."

That's a justification for targeted support. Would that be enough?

There's also the question of timing. As Premier Higgs acknowledged in his interview with Power & Politics, financial support will be of limited use as long as large numbers of people are uncomfortable with the idea of flying — and have nowhere to go.

Free-market disciples might turn their noses up at all of this, but the Trudeau government probably doesn't see this as the right moment to insist on laissez-faire economics. And perhaps the other federal parties will be reluctant to make the case for doing nothing as well.

For Trudeau, the challenge is to come up with an approach that makes things better — without making his government's political burden significantly heavier.Two hours after WestJet announced on Wednesday that it was curtailing its flights to and from Atlantic Canada, an email went out to all MPs and senators from Liberal MP Chris Bittle, parliamentary secretary to Transport Minister Marc Garneau.

For Trudeau, the challenge is to come up with an approach that makes things better — without making his government's political burden significantly heavier.OTTAWA–The Bank of Canada is pushing back against Conservative questions about its independence from the federal government, saying its inflation target — not politics — is guiding its response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The central bank was pulled into the pandemic political fray Thursday when Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre suggested the bank was enabling the Liberal government’s deficit-spending habits.

In an interview with Bloomberg News, Poilievre warned the central bank to avoid acting as an “ATM” for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s emergency pandemic programs.

At issue is the bank’s unprecedented purchase of billions of dollars worth of government bonds in an effort to stabilize the economy, which has been rocked by rolling lockdowns during the COVID-19 crisis. The bank has committed to buying $5 billion in government bonds each week during the crisis, a policy known as “quantitative easing” which is intended to inject cash into the economy.

Poilievre called the practice — which has been employed on a massive scale by central banks around the world during the crisis, including in the U.S., U.K., and Australia — “printing money,” and suggested it was a “pyramid scheme.”

“Expanding the bank’s balance sheet during a short-term, once-in-a-lifetime pandemic lockdown is different than perpetually buying and inflating the financial assets of the wealthy at everyone else’s expense,” Poilievre said in a written statement to the Star.

“Trickle-down economics does not work. We need a bottom-up, worker-led recovery.”

The bank has said it will stop its quantitative easing efforts once the economy has recovered after COVID-19.

Poilievre’s characterization was challenged by independent economic analysts who spoke to the Star on Thursday.

“Every central bank is probing the outer limits of monetary intervention to an extent we’ve never seen before, but the Bank of Canada is hardly alone in this intervention,” said David Rosenberg, the chief economist at Rosenberg Research. “I mean, look what’s happened in the world around us.”

Rosenberg pointed out that the bank’s counterpart, the U.S. Federal Reserve, is openly calling on Washington for more fiscal stimulus to weather COVID-19’s economic storm.

“Is Canada behaving irresponsibly? I don’t see that,” Rosenberg said. “Is (Bank of Canada governor) Tiff Macklem somehow political? I find that really hard to believe,”

The Bank of Canada is not typically drawn in to the cut and thrust of partisan politics. As a Crown corporation, it operates at arm’s-length from the government and has legislated independence to set the country’s monetary policy with an eye to keeping inflation low.

While the bank’s efforts to stabilize the Canadian economy during COVID-19 are unprecedented, they should not be viewed as political said Scotiabank chief economist Jean-François Perrault.

“There is no question that central banks around the world … have needed to undertake absolutely exceptional measures to try and stabilize economies and put them on a path to recovery,” said Perrault, who previously worked at the central bank and in government.

“The bank is obviously an inflation targeting organization. That’s job number one, that’s its mandate. I’m 100 per cent convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that the actions that they’ve taken were all done with the objective of stabilizing inflation.”

In a statement, the Bank of Canada said it has been “consistently clear that the policy actions taken by the bank during the COVID-19 pandemic are always guided by our mandated inflation objective.”

Alex Paterson, a spokesperson for the central bank, also pointed to a previous statement that the bank intends to continue its policy of quantitative easing until the recovery from COVID-19 is “well underway.”

The Liberal government was less guarded in its response to Poilievre’s charges.

“The Conservatives are recklessly politicizing the role of the independent, and widely respected Bank of Canada,” wrote Katherine Cuplinskas, a spokesperson for Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland.
