In an attempt to protect the government, Liberal chairs of two House of Commons committees are inappropriately shutting down committee meetings when members bring forward motions seeking to reopen the WE Charity probe, charge Conservative MPs.

Liberal chairs on the finance committee and the Procedure and House Affairs Committee (PROC) have both shut down meetings since Parliament returned on Sept. 23. On each occasion, the committee was in the middle of discussing a motion requesting access to documents related to the WE Charity scandal.

Conservative MP and finance vice-chair Pierre Poilievre said the committee’s accountability mechanism is eliminated when the chair ends a meeting to protect the government.

“Committees are supposed to hold governments accountable,” he said. “It’s not appropriate for the chair to simply slam the gavel, flip the switch, and turn out the lights when the government is embarrassed.”

Finance committee chair Wayne Easter last week suspended a meeting when Poilievre introduced a motion that sought to give the committee access to previously pre-redacted documents related to the WE Charity scandal.

The meeting was about two hours in, when Poilievre rose on a point of privilege — used when some question requires immediate consideration, such as making a parliamentary inquiry — to introduce his motion.

Easter told iPolitics he suspended the finance meeting because the committee clerk alerted him that Poilievre’s motion contained a technical procedural problem. While he had to recognize Poilievre on his point of privilege, he couldn’t rule on it, since only the speaker of the House can do that, he said.

As well, the finance committee was dealing with two other motions brought before the committee when Poilievre introduced his on a point of privilege and “effectively jumped the queue,” Easter said.

But Poilievre said that concern over whether a point of privilege is in order doesn’t normally lead to a committee suspension. He said debates about whether motions are in order happen all the time; the chair typically rules on the matter, rather than opting to “switch off the light.”

Poilievre said members of the finance committee aren’t looking to remove Easter as chair yet, but they are following the chair’s conduct carefully.

“He can’t continue in his role, if he’s going to terminate meetings without the permission of the committee when things get uncomfortable for the government,” Poilievre said.

The finance committee is one of three House committees that have sought to reopen an investigation into the WE Charity scandal, which was shut down when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prorogued Parliament in August.

The controversy came to light this summer after the Trudeau government outsourced the $500-million Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG) — a program to pay students for volunteering — to WE Charity, an organization with which his family, and that of then-finance minister Bill Morneau, had close financial ties for years.

In its first meeting since Parliament’s return, PROC committee chair and Liberal MP Ruby Sahota adjourned a meeting without the consent of the Conservative members on the committee, and cancelled a meeting scheduled for the next day without providing an explanation.

The committee was in the middle of discussing a motion from Conservative MP Karen Vecchio that would have members of the Trudeau government testify before the committee and order the release of previously redacted WE Charity documents, among other things.

“(The rules) were clearly broken,” Conservative MP and chief opposition whip Blake Richards told iPolitics at the time. “There’s clearly an effort here to avoid the meetings. There’s clearly an effort to cover up the matter at hand, which is the WE scandal.”

Thomas Hall, a retired 20-year veteran of the House of Commons and a former procedural clerk, said a chair does not have the right to adjourn a committee meeting without the consent of the committee members. A chair can suspend a committee meeting if it’s disruptive and he or she needs to make a decision, he said. But in these instances, the chair should just adjourn for a short period before calling the meeting back.

Hall also said the committee has the power to set its schedule, and the chair shouldn’t be cancelling committee meetings.

If committee members feel the chair is not acting appropriately, their only recourse is to replace the chair with another member on the committee, Hall said.

The finance committee will address the “illegitimate suspension” when the meeting resumes on Thursday, Poilievre said.

Furthermore, because Canadians returned a minority government in the last federal election, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should respect the opposition majority, “particularly when it comes to accountability and transparency,” Poilievre said.

“(Trudeau) doesn’t get to have 100 per cent control.”

This story has been corrected to attribute the following quote to Pierre Poilievre: “He can’t continue in his role, if he’s going to terminate meetings without the permission of the committee when things get uncomfortable for the government.” Having tasted something like freedom over the summer, most Quebecers are back living under a complex array of public health rules, wondering if the rest of the pandemic will be one long roller-coaster ride between extremes.

When Premier François Legault announced last month a 28-day partial lockdown to quell a rising tide of infections, he counselled Quebecers to get used to a "fragile balance" while they wait for a vaccine.

"We'll see if we can open up again at a certain point and find a bit of normal life," he told journalists in Quebec City at the time.

"But if there are too many cases, or if there is less co-operation from the population, then we'll have to go backward."

Legault was describing what has been the dominant approach in many Western countries to dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic: the lurch from lockdown to freedom and back to lockdown again when cases rise.

In Quebec, the back-and-forth has been more abrupt than elsewhere in Canada.

The Legault government didn't hesitate to close schools and businesses early in the pandemic. Then many restrictions were lifted in quick succession at the start of the summer, and for a few months life almost went back to normal.

Legault was reluctant at first to reimpose restrictions as cases started to creep upward in August.

But when the government finally did respond, it didn't wait long to resort to drastic measures — banning all social gatherings in so-called red zones, including Montreal and Quebec City.

Montreal's public health director questioned whether it was sustainable to continue oscillating between poles of relative freedom and relative confinement.

"If we have to live with the virus, do we always want to be doing the yo-yo?" Mylène Drouin wondered last week.

She proposed, instead, finding a stable set of restrictions to keep transmission more consistently in check.

"We probably never should have talked about deconfinement.... We have to identify measures that we can live with for many months to come."

The tricky part is figuring out what those measures are.

28 days — and beyond

Quebec is currently halfway through a 28-day partial lockdown. Along with the ban on social gatherings, bars and restaurant dining rooms have been closed, as have gyms and movie theatres.

These are all things Quebecers were able to enjoy over the summer. But that may have been a mistake, according to some experts.

"The summer has shown us that if we back off on the restrictions too quickly and too completely, we are going to have this bouncing between no restrictions and then a rise in cases and a sudden and fairly strong restrictions," said Dr. Matthew Oughton, an infectious disease specialist at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal.

In at least one measurement, the current partial lockdown is yielding the desired results. Quebec's Rt, which tracks the number of people a single person is likely to infect, has dropped back below one, said Université de Montréal epidemiologist Hélène Carabin.

"If I only think in terms of infectious disease epidemiology, that's obviously what you need to do," she said.

But, like most other health experts, Carabin acknowledged that lockdowns, even partial ones, entail serious collateral damage to the economy and to people's mental health.

In order to avoid the need for disruptive lockdowns, some are suggesting that more restrictions be kept in place after the current wave subsides, as opposed to returning to the level of freedom enjoyed in the summer.

"I think there's probably a middle ground where you don't entirely remove all restrictions and that will reduce the amplitude of the restrictions," said Oughton.

Threading the needle

One rule of thumb to consider is how many interactions we have on a daily basis where we are exposed to the virus, such as conversations where masks aren't worn or physical distancing isn't kept.

In June, a model released by Quebec's public health research institute, the INSPQ, predicted that if everyone limited their average daily number of unprotected contacts to between three and six, then cases and hospitalizations would remain low.

If, however, the daily average of unprotected contacts rose to between six and 10, then both cases and hospitalizations would spike to troublesome levels.

During the spring lockdown in Quebec, the INSPQ researchers estimated daily contacts dropped to 4.5. But that came at the expense of closing schools and vast swaths of the economy.

The current partial lockdown is trying to achieve a similar reduction in contacts while at the same time keeping schools and stores open.

In trying to thread that needle, the Quebec government drafted a long, complex list of activities that were prohibited or allowed only under certain circumstances.

The confusion left many exasperated. "People are confused about what the rules are because they are highly specific," said Erin Strumpf, a health economics expert at McGill.

She suggested that once the current wave of infections has been controlled, Quebec may want to revisit the idea of bubbles.

Limiting our circle of contacts to between two or three households, she said, would help curtail infections while easing the strain on people's mental health.

Strumpf said if the government is interested in drafting more sustainable public health measures, it needs to consider psychological factors alongside epidemiological ones.

"We're not just talking about the virus and the way the virus behaves anymore," she said. "We're talking about how people behave — and that's much more complicated."

Legault was asked earlier this week whether he intended to continue applying the yo-yo approach, going back and forth between states of confinement and freedom.

It wasn't ideal, he admitted, but he also said he didn't see much of an option.

"When you look at just about every other country in the world, they played yo-yo, he said. "What we have before us is an extraordinary situation. No one has been through this before."Having tasted something like freedom over the summer, most Quebecers are back living under a complex array of public health rules, wondering if the rest of the pandemic will be one long roller-coaster ride between extremes.

Dig deeper into the report and you see that nine doctors returned to Alberta, 142 are newly-licensed Alberta trainees, and 139 are new to Alberta but trained somewhere else. You can also see something more important. For those who aren’t working in Alberta anymore, four gave up their licence, five were suspended, three passed away, and 22 retired. The number who left Alberta: 13.

The third-quarter report is a snapshot in time and should be taken with a grain of salt, but taking a hard look at the information contained within and comparing it to trends seen in previous years shows no striking changes. This gives patients in Alberta a glimpse of what we know to be true, but critics ignore: hundreds of physicians come and go every year for different reasons, all of them perfectly understandable.

It’s not easy to talk about how much taxpayers should pay Alberta’s doctors. We pay our 11,000 doctors over $5 billion. That’s 10 per cent of the entire provincial budget. The right amount should take into account the province’s financial situation, generously compensate doctors, and consider regional differences.

I believe we’ve made every effort to do exactly that. For example, this spring we brought in the most comprehensive plan in Canada for recruiting and retaining doctors in our rural communities: increasing how much we pay rural doctors, purchasing dedicated spots in medical schools for students willing to commit to working in rural Alberta, and a raft of other changes.
