Premier Doug Ford may have no choice but to raise taxes next year in order to begin tackling Ontario’s record budget deficit, the province’s fiscal watchdog warns.

With coffers at Queen’s Park ravaged by COVID-19, the independent Financial Accountability Office said Thursday that taxation levels might have to rise.

“If the government were to permanently increase personal income tax revenue by 10 per cent or around $500 per tax filer, starting in 2021-22, the budget deficit would improve by $3.7 billion in the first year and by $4.8 billion by 2025-26,” the office said in a 20-page report.

Speaking to reporters at his daily Queen’s Park teleconference, Ford expressed reluctance at hiking taxes.

“We never believed in this when we first took office about raising taxes. We can drive efficiencies,” the premier said.

The FAO is projecting an Ontario deficit of $37.2 billion this year “due to a sharp drop in revenue coupled with a strong increase in program spending.”

Finance Minister Rod Phillips, who will table a budget next month, has projected the shortfall could be even higher — $38.5 billion — because of the pandemic that has plunged the country into recession.

Phillips has some wiggle room because the FAO pointed out there is still “$9.3 billion in unused contingency funds to specific programs” that could be used to reduce the deficit.

But Ford stressed “we do plan on spending that money” to help deal with the fallout of the virus.

“There’s always things popping up constantly,” he said.

Hopes that Ontario will get back in the black appear to have been dashed for the foreseeable future.

“If the government chose to balance the budget over the next five years, as in its previous recovery plan from the 2019 budget, the FAO estimates that it would require roughly $14 billion in permanent revenue increases or spending cuts, or some combination of both,” the watchdog’s report said.

But Treasury Board President Peter Bethlenfalvy conceded “we’re not going to be balancing for the pre-COVID numbers, I think that’s just the reality.”

Underscoring that “the COVID-19 pandemic and shutdowns have resulted in a historic negative shock to Ontario’s economy,” the FAO said things could have been worse.

“Initial measures to contain the pandemic in Ontario were relatively successful in limiting the spread of the virus through the summer, allowing for an earlier and broader reopening of the economy than first anticipated.”

Indeed, the FAO’s gloomy outlook is actually an improvement upon its projections from when the coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,900 Ontarians and cost 1.2 million jobs, struck in March.

“Faced with a potentially unprecedented economic crisis, the federal and provincial governments quickly introduced, and subsequently enhanced, a variety of programs designed to support household and business incomes during the crisis,” the report said.

“As a result, economic activity began to rebound in May, with stronger than expected gains in employment, household spending and housing investment,” it noted.

“Compared to the FAO’s spring outlook, the decline in economic activity in 2020 is now expected to be less severe. However, the pace of the recovery is expected to moderate through the fall and into next year as government supports begin to taper, some sectors continue to struggle because of restrictions, and significant uncertainty about the future path of the pandemic weighs on the broader economy.”

Ontario’s real gross domestic product is expected to shrink by 6.8 per cent this year, which is better than the nine per cent the FAO feared in the spring.

“Even so, this year’s downturn is expected to be the largest annual decline in economic output on record.”

Things should begin rebounding next year with the fiscal office predicting a healthy 5.1 per cent GDP growth.

Unemployment, which is projected to reach a 26-year high of 9.7 per cent this year, should drop to 8.5 per cent in 2021.

Tax revenues are expected to plunge by 11.2 per cent — $12.1 billion — in 2020-21, offset by a $7.2 billion infusion of federal cash to help with COVID-19.

But NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said “Ford’s penny-pinching has put Ontario on the brink of another health and economic disaster.”

“Doug Ford is sitting on $9.3 billion earmarked for COVID-19 that could make our schools safer, provide protections for seniors and workers in care homes, or increase testing and contact tracing,” Horwath wrote on Twitter.

Liberal MPP Mitzie Hunter (Scarborough-Guildwood) said “Ford has the means, from federal transfers given months ago, to take action.

“Investing sooner could prevent disastrous impacts on our long-term economic recovery,” she said.

Airline passengers trying to fly to the Maritimes say they aren’t being provided with a full refund after WestJet announced it would be significantly cutting services in the East Coast.

On Wednesday, WestJet announced it would suspending flights to Moncton, Fredericton, Sydney and Charlottetown indefinitely, while “significantly” reducing service to Halifax and St. John’s.

It’s a move airline passengers in the Maritimes say makes sense, given the situation brought about by COVID-19. But what doesn’t make sense to them is how they are being reimbursed.

“I don’t blame them for this decision, but they did take my money, they did take my reservation, and now they have to live with the consequences,” said Emmanuel Maicas, who recently booked a trip to the Dominican Republic.

Maicas says he spent nearly $6,000 on flights for the family trip. He says the travel credits are of no use to him if WestJet isn’t returning to Moncton, where he lives.

“If WestJet does not provide the service to me, well, I want my money back,” he said.

“In my mind, the only thing that will satisfy me is a full refund.” Tweet This

That’s a similar situation that Megan Hilderpants has found herself in. She’s feeling slighted by WestJet after she and her wife booked flights to Fredericton just a few days before Wednesday’s announcement.

“It kind of seemed like they were already aware like this was unfurling,” said Hilderpants. “It seemed sort of dodgy that they would sell us tickets that soon.”

Hilderpants is also in the process of getting her money back, as Fredericton is the only location she and her partner are considering travelling to.

In a statement, WestJet spokesperson Morgan Bell said the Canadian Transportation Agency has determined that refunds to travel credits is acceptable in light of the situation brought about by COVID-19.”

But passenger rights activist Gábor Lukács says providing vouchers rather than a full refund is unlawful and verging on fraudulent.

“WestJet is breaking the law here by not complying with the fundamental obligation to refund passengers or rebook them,” said Lukács. “As an airline you have an obligation to rebook passengers or flights of other airlines.

“If they choose not to, you have an obligation to refund them in the original form of payment.” Tweet This

Lukács says WestJet’s decision may be justifiable from a public health perspective, but its vouchers do not follow provincial, federal, nor common law.

“As a general contractual principle, if you make a contract to provide services and you are unable or unwilling to perform the services, the bare minimum you have to do is give back the party the bare minimum they paid,” he said.

As for the airline passengers, they don’t expect their fight with WestJet to end swiftly.

“Give us our money back, would be nice. That would be ideal,” said Hilderpants.Send this page to someone via email

The Liberals argue they’ve already handed over plenty, and the opposition is simply on a fishing expedition to try to keep the scandal going. So the Liberals are responding with the only arrow in their quiver: a filibuster.

By late Thursday, both committees finished talking for the day without resolution, when Bloc Quebecois MPs joined Liberals in voting to pause.

It amounts to a game of parliamentary chicken, as each side must decide how committed they are to either delaying or forcing the vote.

“I’m saying if it takes all night, if it takes all week, we will be here until the Liberals stop obstructing, stop interfering with work of Parliament, and allow us to do our jobs as parliamentarians so we can get on with dealing with the many, many other issues that are facing Canadians,” said NDP MP Charlie Angus at the outset of Thursday’s ethics committee meeting.

“I’ve heard from members of the committee that this is Ottawa bubble, this isn’t what people want us to focus on,” said Conservative MP Michael Barrett. “Well, I can tell you, folks of any political stripe don’t like corruption, and they don’t like cover-ups. And that’s what this is.”

In the finance committee, meanwhile, the proceedings occasionally descended into farce. Liberal MP Peter Fragiskatos complained that Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre had turned his computer camera off; NDP MP Peter Julian said there’s no rule against turning off your camera; Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen then compared Poilievre to the cartoon character Polkaroo, earning a rebuke from the committee chair. It went on like this all afternoon.
