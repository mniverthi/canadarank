Canada’s main opposition party is cautioning the central bank against financing Justin Trudeau’s spending plans beyond immediate pandemic emergency measures, thrusting the Bank of Canada into a political firestorm.

Lawmaker Pierre Poilievre, chief Conservative spokesman on finance issues, said the bank “should not be an ATM for Trudeau’s insatiable spending appetites.” He raised concerns about the long-term impacts of monetary expansion and urged Governor Tiff Macklem to steer clear of “ideological” debates.

“We will be watching the Bank of Canada with great skepticism,” Poilievre said in an interview. “If the Bank of Canada does want to start getting more and more political, then it will be held to the same level of political accountability as other political entities.”

Since Covid-19 hit, the central bank has purchased C$168 billion ($128 billion) in government bonds, marking its first foray into what’s known as quantitative easing.

Poilievre’s comments highlight the political minefield Macklem is navigating as his central bank becomes primary financier of Trudeau’s massive budget deficits. The longer the Bank of Canada buys up the debt, or advocates for continued spending as it has done, the deeper it will be dragged into debates about government priorities.

Independence at Risk

It’s a precarious position for an institution that enjoys a long history of independence and is rarely subject to political attack.

The Bank of Canada has been forced into buying up government debt to prevent a pick-up in interest rates that would cripple the economy. Its primary purpose isn’t to fund the government but to ensure a strong recovery, guided by its 2% inflation target. Theoretically, those bond holdings could be shed once the economy recovers.

“I don’t think we’re at a point, and I don’t anticipate we’ll be at a point, where there is the question about central bank credibility,” Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, told BNN Bloomberg television Thursday. “The central bank is independent by law, they have a very specific objective -- to target inflation -- and I think the governor has made it very, very clear that that’s sacrosanct.”

On the fiscal side, there’s broad consensus among political parties in Canada that massive government spending is needed through the pandemic. But there are divisions over the next steps.

Trudeau -- who lost his legislative majority in last year’s election -- has been hinting he wants to keep the fiscal taps open into the recovery. He kicked off a new parliamentary session in September by pledging to pursue a far-reaching and potentially expensive post-pandemic agenda that includes a national daycare system, pharmacare and more spending on affordable housing and the environment.

That won support from the left-leaning New Democratic Party, staving off another election for now. But the Conservatives, who are enjoying a bump in the polls under a new leader, are pushing back against Trudeau’s long-term vision.

Trudeau Plots Sharpest Turn Left in Economic Policy Since 1980s

“The world is completely revolutionized, so we’re told, and so the logic goes that governments can just print money to pay their bills and there’ll be no consequences,” Poilievre said. “It’s insane.”

He also said the Bank of Canada should “stay out of political and ideological debates and stick to its job, which is inflation targeting.”

Trudeau’s government hit back Thursday, saying Poilievre is heading down a perilous path.

“The Conservatives are recklessly politicizing the role of the independent and widely respected Bank of Canada,” Katherine Cuplinskas, press secretary for Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, said by email. “Our Liberal government’s commitment is to do whatever it takes to keep Canadians safe and healthy and to protect our economy during this global pandemic.”

While the Bank of Canada is not alone in buying up government debt, it’s been one of the more aggressive central banks this year -- growing its balance sheet as a share of gross domestic product more rapidly than the U.S. Federal Reserve. That’s in part because of faster growing deficits in Canada.

Canadian government budget shortfalls -- including provinces -- will end 2020 at near 20% of GDP, from near balance before the crisis, according to the International Monetary Fund. That represents the fourth highest projected deficit in the world, after Libya, Aruba and the Maldives.

Monetary policy makers led by Macklem, meanwhile, have pledged to continue buying bonds until the economic recovery is “ well underway.”

At the current pace, the central bank will control 56% of Canada’s government bond market by the end of next year, from 29% today, according to estimates from Ian Pollick, head of fixed income, currency and commodity research at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

‘Out of Thin Air’

Poilievre said creating “currency out of thin air” is a recipe for higher inflation and a weakening Canadian dollar. It also fuels inequalities as low interest rates drive up asset values for the rich.

“Expanding the bank’s balance sheet during a short-term, once-in-a-lifetime pandemic lockdown is different than perpetually buying and inflating the financial assets of the wealthy at everyone else’s expense,” Poilievre said.

While the Bank of Canada is operationally independent, the government does reset its mandate every five years and opposition lawmakers have some oversight responsibilities through parliamentary committees. The central bank has been mandated to target inflation at around 2% for almost three decades.

Even with extraordinary pandemic measures, the Bank of Canada isn’t projecting any major pick-up in consumer prices. Rather, it’s projecting inflation will remain below target over the next couple of years because the economy is operating with excess capacity, necessitating the monetary stimulus.

( Updates with government response in 14th and 15th paragraphs. ) Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that applying for the new Canada Recovery Benefit would be "simple" and that no Canadian would be left behind in the transition to a new pandemic benefit.

But some say the application process has been deeply frustrating and they still don't know when — or even if — they'll get the money.

Hajar Pittman told CBC News the application process has been a nightmare.

"I've never felt this hopeless," said the Brampton, Ont. mother of two toddlers. She was on maternity leave when the pandemic hit. She was laid off from her job in the airline industry in June and collected the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) — the benefit replaced by the CRB — throughout the summer.

Pittman said that when she first tried to apply for the new Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) on Monday, she got an error message — "COV-026" — telling her she was ineligible for the benefit without explaining why.

It took hours of phone calls with the Canada Revenue Agency, she said, before a CRA agent suggested that the fact she collected parental leave benefits might be causing confusion in the CRB process. Pittman said she has now requested a letter from Service Canada clarifying her status.

Pittman said she was also told she might have to wait 21 business days for that letter to arrive. Once she gets it, she'll have to send it on to the CRA — so she has no idea how long the total application process could take.

In the meantime — instead of the $500 per week she could be collecting from the CRB — she has no money coming in. And looking for a job in a pandemic has led her nowhere.

"I'm relying on family and friends and savings that I've put away over the years," she told CBC News.

"I'm just hoping and praying that this will be resolved soon because I don't know how long I can go without collecting any financial support from the government. I was really relying on that for myself and my children."

She's not alone. CBC News has received at least three dozen complaints about access to the benefit.

Tracey Crosson, administrator of the "Canadians on $2000/month CERB support group" on Facebook, said she's seeing dozens of complaints a day from people struggling to access the CRB.

"People are having a real hard time with it. They're getting errors and it shouldn't be that way."

Confusion over EI applications

Crosson said the comments she's seen in the Facebook group suggest many people are experiencing problems because they've applied for Employment Insurance in the past but are no longer eligible.

Changes to the federal government's suite of pandemic benefits made more Canadians eligible for Employment Insurance. Those who are eligible for EI are supposed to use it. Those who aren't are expected to apply for the CRB.

Crosson said Trudeau's claim that no one would be left behind in the transition from the CERB to the CRB rings hollow now.

"Why is it that there are people slipping through the cracks?" she asked.

(Crosson's Facebook group was set up by UBIWorks, a non-profit that advocates for universal basic income.)

The Canada Revenue Agency said in a statement that it is aware some applicants are receiving error codes related to their eligibility.

It said when people apply through CRA's "My Account" online or through the automated phone line, the applications go through a verification process.

"The system checks a variety of data sources to determine eligibility," the statement said. "For example, the CRA can verify if the $5,000 income threshold has been met, or detect the possibility of fraud. Applicants who are deemed ineligible for CRB may still be eligible for EI."

The statement noted that as of end of day Wednesday, 497,100 applications had been approved for the CRB.

The agency did not say how many people had been told they were not eligible for the benefit.

Brace for delays, says Service Canada

To handle what's expected to be an unprecedented number of EI claims and a record number of calls over the coming weeks, Service Canada has almost doubled its complement of specialized call centre agents. It's still warning people to expect long waits.

Mara Del Bianco said she also got a 'COV-026' message telling her she was ineligible for benefits without telling her why. Her problem appears to be similar to Pittman's — involving a past claim for benefits for which she is no longer eligible.

Del Bianco said she also spent hours on hold with the CRA and Service Canada. She described the process as confused; at one point, she said, she was asked to provide documents by fax.

She also asked for a letter clarifying her EI eligibility. Like Pittman, she's still waiting for it.

"[I'm] stressed out. Tired," she said. "Just trying to ... I'm trying to keep things afloat."

For Pittman, it's been especially maddening to witness what she called a lack of communication between Service Canada and the CRA.

More than anything, though, she just wants her situation resolved quickly.

Adams said the government is attempting several reforms at once and it should be taking it one step at a time. He said some or all of the reforms might reduce prices, but they might also limit access and by applying all the reforms at the same time, it will be impossible to tell which are working.

“The concern is that patients will be hurt as collateral damage, as the government seems to be trying to do too many things at the same time.”

He said he worries about the early signs that drug companies will walk away from Canada because the prices will be set too low.

“I won’t say it’s a big red flashing light. I will say it’s an amber flashing light.”

Trikafta, made by U.S. company Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is a breakthrough treatment for cystic fibrosis. But Vertex has yet to submit the treatment to Health Canada for approval, which means it is not available to patients living here. In the U.S., it costs more than $300,000 per patient per year.

Health Minister Patty Hajdu was asked about the drug in question period last week and said the government has contacted the company to encourage it to bring the drug to Canada.

“We have reached out to the corporation to ask it to apply. We have assured it that we will expedite the review of Trikafta.”

Hajdu has defended the changes the government is set to implement, arguing they will save Canadians billions.

The changes have received support from Canadians worried about the rising cost of drugs, with more than 2,000 people signing a petition submitted in the House of Commons calling on the government to move ahead with the new rules.
