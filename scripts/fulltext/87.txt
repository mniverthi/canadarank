The wastewater tracking system, developed by local researchers, is now being used daily by Ottawa Public Health to monitor the spread of COVID-19.

Wastewater tracking has been studied by researchers in Ottawa and elsewhere since the beginning of the pandemic. But at a time when cases are increasing and the system of testing, tracking and tracing is strained, it could have a new appeal across the province.

Wastewater sampling offers a measure of COVID-19 that is not influenced by how many people are being tested. Crucially, sampling wastewater measures virus that has been shed by people before they show symptoms and are less likely to seek, or qualify, for testing.
