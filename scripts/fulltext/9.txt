OTTAWA—In duelling expressions of outrage, Liberals and Conservatives exchanged demands for opposing candidates to drop out of federal byelections in Toronto as advance polls opened on Friday.

The Liberals took the first shot, when Quebec MP Greg Fergus — who is also the chair of the Parliamentary Black Caucus in Ottawa — condemned how the Conservative candidate in York Centre posted on Twitter about U.S. vice presidential contender Kamala Harris’s racial identity.

Fergus shared a screenshot of the post, which was dated Aug. 13. In it, Tory candidate Julius Tiangson replied to another, unseen tweet by seemingly comparing the ethnicities of Harris to then-Conservative leadership contender Leslyn Lewis.

Lewis is Black and Harris is Black and South Asian.

“Leslyn Lewis is legit Black,” Tiangson wrote. “Kamala Harris is transracial (a racial fluidity concept that identifies oneself to a particular usefulness…)!”

Fergus called on Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole to immediately “fire” Tiangson for the comment, which he said the Liberals found in a cached version of the candidate’s now-deleted Twitter account.

“It almost sounds like (he is saying) she’s just using it, to instrumentalize her race for advantage. I don’t know what planet he’s on. It hasn’t been much of an advantage, when you’re facing anti-Black racism,” Fergus said.

“And what is ‘legit Black’? Am I ‘legit Black’? Where is he going with this?”

Tiangson responded with a written statement to the Star, accusing the Liberals of trying to “distract voters here from the many ethical scandals surrounding this government.

“As an ethnic minority who immigrated to this country, I think it’s great to see Kamala Harris running for vice president,” said Tiangson, who came to Canada from the Philippines in 1985.

“Liberals using an out of context tweet won’t derail the hard work we’re doing to stand up for the Canadians left behind by this government.”

Tiangson’s campaign did not respond to a followup question about the context of his tweet.

O’Toole’s office also did not respond to a request for comment Friday.

Hours later, Conservatives unearthed a tweet of their own — this one from the Liberal candidate running in the other byelection in Toronto Centre, former CTV host Marci Ien. Dated May 2011, months before she was named co-host of the network’s Canada AM morning show, Ien posted on Twitter about watching a 9/11 conspiracy theory documentary.

“Watching ‘Loose Change 9-11: An American Coup’. Really makes you think about what really happened on September 11, 2001,” she wrote.

That film, one version of which was co-produced by the radical American conspiracist Alex Jones, has been widely criticized for spreading misinformation.

Cory Hann, the Conservative party’s director of communications, said on Twitter that Ien should apologize and resign for “peddling” conspiracy theories.

“These truther conspiracies have long been debunked, and only serve to harm the families of the thousands of victims of this terror attack,” Hann said.

“She shouldn’t just apologize, she should resign.”

In an email to the Star Friday evening, Ien said she posted the tweet after watching parts of the film on YouTube nine years ago.

“I regret the impression it leaves, as I have always been so deeply saddened by the horrific destruction and tragic loss caused by al-Qaeda’s attacks on 9/11,” she wrote.

“Throughout my career as a journalist and broadcaster, I’ve spoken repeatedly with the families of 9/11 victims and shared their stories — as a candidate, I firmly believe that keeping Canadians safe from such tragedies must always be a foremost priority of every parliamentarian.”

The competing calls for opponents to drop out come as tens of thousands of people can begin voting in advance polls in Toronto Centre and York Centre, where federal byelections are being held amidst the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada’s biggest city.

The seats are empty after Liberal MPs Michael Levitt and Bill Morneau, the former finance minister, resigned this summer.

The elections are scheduled for Oct. 26.
