Winter is coming for the Calgary area this weekend as a low-pressure system is expected to bring snow, strong winds and temperatures below the freezing point.

As of Thursday morning, Calgary along with much of Alberta south of Grande Prairie is currently under a special weather statement. A band of snow will likely produce up to 10 cm of snow by Friday afternoon, with higher amounts along the foothills and in the mountain parks.

Although much of the Calgary area had some snow this week, the anticipated drop in temperature is what makes the coming storm noteworthy, said Blaine Lowry, a meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, on Wednesday afternoon.

“We’re going from temperatures that were in the low to mid-20s a couple of weekends ago to seeing this weekend’s highs struggling to make it above zero and accumulating snow across lots of central and southern Alberta,” said Lowry.
