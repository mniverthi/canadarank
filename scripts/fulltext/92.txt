Premier Doug Ford's government is revoking a policy that for the past decade has forced Ontario school boards to hire only from a pool of teachers with the most seniority.

The hiring rule "rewards union seniority over one's merit," Education Minister Stephen Lecce said Thursday in announcing the province's move to repeal the policy, known as Regulation 274.

"This is about giving principals more flexibility to hire the very best teaching staff," Lecce told a news conference in Vaughan. "Merit will lead hiring in our schools."

The revocation is being triggered by hiring delays experienced by school boards this fall as they responded to the staffing changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, said Lecce.

Smaller class sizes in some grades and locations around Ontario, combined with surging demand for online learning meant a sudden spike in job openings for teachers in recent weeks, prompting many school boards to go on hiring sprees.

But the restrictions of the rule meant that principals could not fill the vacancies quickly enough, said Lecce.

"They are constrained by an outdated process when they need to get qualified teachers into the class right now," he said. "This regulation, more than it ever did, is impeding the ability to swiftly hire," he said.

The policy was created by the then-Liberal government in 2012.

When school boards post a new teaching job, the regulation requires them to hire only from among the five applicants with the most seniority as long-term supply teachers, provided they have the necessary academic qualifications.

"For nearly a decade, Ontario has hired educators based on seniority and that did not serve our students well. In fact, it undermined the quality of teaching in many cases," Lecce said. .

While the Ford government proposed eliminating the rule at the education bargaining table last year, the collective agreements eventually signed with the province's teachers unions kept it in place. However, the government retained the right to rescind the policy, as all such regulations are subject to cabinet approval.

The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario accused Lecce of "spinning myths" about hiring.

Some school boards have suggested the rule makes it harder for younger applicants straight out of their education degree to break into the system and constrains boards from diversifying the teaching workforce.

The umbrella group of Ontario's public school boards welcomed the move.

"Transparent and equitable hiring practices are essential in order to ensure a highly qualified teacher workforce that reflects the diversity of students and school communities, and meets local needs," said Cathy Abraham, president of the Ontario Public School Boards' Association, in a statement.

The Liberals argue they’ve already handed over plenty, and the opposition is simply on a fishing expedition to try to keep the scandal going. So the Liberals are responding with the only arrow in their quiver: a filibuster.

By late Thursday, both committees finished talking for the day without resolution, when Bloc Quebecois MPs joined Liberals in voting to pause.

It amounts to a game of parliamentary chicken, as each side must decide how committed they are to either delaying or forcing the vote.

“I’m saying if it takes all night, if it takes all week, we will be here until the Liberals stop obstructing, stop interfering with work of Parliament, and allow us to do our jobs as parliamentarians so we can get on with dealing with the many, many other issues that are facing Canadians,” said NDP MP Charlie Angus at the outset of Thursday’s ethics committee meeting.

“I’ve heard from members of the committee that this is Ottawa bubble, this isn’t what people want us to focus on,” said Conservative MP Michael Barrett. “Well, I can tell you, folks of any political stripe don’t like corruption, and they don’t like cover-ups. And that’s what this is.”

In the finance committee, meanwhile, the proceedings occasionally descended into farce. Liberal MP Peter Fragiskatos complained that Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre had turned his computer camera off; NDP MP Peter Julian said there’s no rule against turning off your camera; Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen then compared Poilievre to the cartoon character Polkaroo, earning a rebuke from the committee chair. It went on like this all afternoon.Article content continued

Experts are warning that some countries are tilting toward “vaccine nationalism” — a focus on competing to take care of their own populations first rather than sufficiently cooperating with the global community, especially poorer countries, to ensure equitable access to a coronavirus vaccine. Canada, which has pre-purchased nearly 300 million doses from a handful of vaccine candidates, could be headed in that direction.

Writing in the Atlantic in August, Alan Bernstein, president and chief executive of the Canada-based global research organization CIFAR and a member of the Canadian Covid-19 Vaccine Task Force, lauded international cooperation in researching a vaccine. He wrote that he was “optimistic that the world will have a safe and effective vaccine by the end of this year or early 2021.”

That is very good news. But “the world” doesn’t necessarily mean everyone, he cautioned. “I worry that people everywhere won’t have equal access to it,” he added.

As many observers have pointed out, once a vaccine is developed, billions of doses will be needed to administer it to everyone in the world. It’s not unlikely that the vaccine will require more than one shot. That’s going to cost us. Of course, there’s no alternative. States must pay to protect public health and prepare the way toward an eventual return to something like normal, saving countries billions in the long run.

Researchers Ronald Labonte, Katrina Plamondon, Mira Johri and Srinivas Murthy, writing in the Conversation last month, echoed Bernstein’s concern. They argued that Canada is part of “the premier league of the vaccine nationalists,” a small group of countries that have bought “more than half the world’s expected short-term supply of vaccines.”

Of course, the ultimate question of whether Canada is a vaccine nationalist — or to what extent — is not whether the country purchases doses or how many, but rather how many it supplies to its own citizens, compared with those around the world who might not otherwise have timely access to a vaccine — or any access at all.

Labonte and his co-writers argued that Canada should pledge at least as much internationally through the global COVAX effort — a vaccine research and distribution alliance — as it does domestically. They’re right. The dictates of justice and equity demand that the governments of the world work together to reduce harm, save lives and end the pandemic. So does raw self-interest.

In a recent recording for my podcast “Open to Debate,” Bernstein acknowledged the humanitarian necessity of wealthy nations making doses available for poorer ones. He also pointed out that, like it or not, we are all in this together until the end. “This pandemic will not be over until everyone is vaccinated,” he said. “If the virus is anywhere, it’s everywhere.”

On balance, the nature of the pandemic implies a clear, rational and just way forward — for wealthy countries to contribute what it takes to get the entire world vaccinated as soon as possible. “I don’t view it as an either/or decision, this tension between looking after one’s own country and contributing to a multilateral initiative,” Bernstein said. “Rich countries can do both, and rich countries should do both.”

So far, Canada has committed 440 million Canadian dollars to COVAX, though half of that sum is for domestic doses. Last week, China joined the effort. The United States and Russia remain holdouts.

As part of the international push, and despite — or perhaps because of — the lack of U.S. leadership, Canada should contribute more to the global effort to procure vaccine doses for poorer countries. Not only is it in the country’s own interest to stamp out the virus worldwide, but Canada has also long been the beneficiary of colonialism and exploitation abroad, from the founding of the state itself to ongoing exploitative extractive, productive and trade practices.

Canada’s perspective should not be “one for you, one for me,” but be scaled to ensure that the country is fully part of a concerted global effort to distribute the vaccine to every nation, regardless of whether it is rich or poor, in a timely manner. This effort must therefore include not only vaccine doses, but also the means by which to distribute and administer them wherever they are needed, for as long as they are needed.

The pandemic is a global affair. Now is not the time to imagine borders as barriers to a swift and full resolution of the pandemic once a vaccine or vaccines become available. This moment is a test of Canada’s commitment to a better, more equitable world.
