Two House of Commons committee meetings dragged on for hours Thursday as Liberal MPs continued to filibuster opposition efforts to reopen their investigations into the WE Charity affair.

The finance committee spent 11 hours debating amendments to a Conservative motion denouncing redactions to roughly 5,000 pages of documents released by the government in August — just as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prorogued Parliament, shutting down four separate committee investigations into the affair.

The ethics committee met for 10 hours, discussing a Conservative motion calling on Speakers' Spotlight, the agency that arranged speaking engagements for Trudeau's wife, mother and brother at WE events, to hand over 12 years of receipts for the trio's paid appearances.

Both finished talking for the day without resolution, when Bloc Quebecois MPs joined Liberals in voting to pause.

WE Charity, which was to have been paid $43.5 million to manage a now-defunct federal student volunteering program, has already disclosed that it paid Margaret and Alexandre Trudeau more than $350,000 over the years.

Trudeau's wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, was paid a one-time fee of $1,400 for an event in 2012, before her husband became prime minister.

Liberal members of the ethics committee complained that the motion is too broad, a "fishing expedition" aimed at delving into the financial affairs of the prime minister's relatives beyond their involvement with WE.

They also argued that it is wrong for MPs to investigate members of another MP's family and that the matter should be left with the federal ethics commissioner, who is already investigating Trudeau and former finance minister Bill Morneau, who also had close family ties to WE.

In the process, they read portions of the Conflict of Interest Act into the record, recounted the history of the ethics committee and embarked on lengthy digressions on entirely unrelated matters.

Allegations of 'micro-aggressions'

Liberal MP Han Dong went on at length about the government's anti-racism strategy, recounting anecdotes of Asian-Canadians who've been subjected to racism during the COVID-19 pandemic.

He argued the committee — which also deals with access to information and privacy issues — should be dealing with the impact of facial-recognition technology on people of colour rather than pursuing the WE affair, on which Trudeau, his chief of staff, Morneau, the clerk of the Privy Council and multiple other public servants have already testified.

After several opposition MPs interrupted to question the relevance of Dong's digression to the motion before the committee, Liberal MP Greg Fergus, chair of the parliamentary Black caucus, intervened to suggest that the interruptions themselves were evidence of unconscious bias.

"The constant interruption I know it's not the intent of my honourable colleagues, but it just reminds me of the micro-aggressions that a lot of Canadians of colour face. I don't hear other members being interrupted," he said, urging them to allow Dong to continue speaking.

New Democrat MP Charlie Angus countered that if Liberals want to get on with a study of facial-recognition technology or anything else, they need only let the WE documents motion come to a vote and the committee could move on.

"I'm asking him not to play games, not to throw these heavily loaded insinuations down at my colleagues," Angus said. "If he wants to talk about something, just bring this to a vote so we can get this thing done."

But neither the opposition members nor the Liberals showed any signs of backing down.

Indeed, Liberal MP Francesco Sorbara, who went on at length about how wrong he believes it is to violate the privacy of another MP's mother and brother, said at one point: "I'll go back to that a thousand times over the next 24 hours if I need to."

Angus similarly declared: "If it takes all night, if it takes all week, we will be here until the Liberals stop obstructing, stop interfering with the work of Parliament, allow us to do our jobs as parliamentarians."

Special committee under discussion

Conservative MPs accused Liberal backbenchers of embarrassing themselves by participating in a coverup for Trudeau.

"The action of a multi-day filibuster by members of the government is a government-led coverup," Michael Barrett said.

Thursday's meeting was a continuation of a standoff that stalled the ethics committee for hours last week.

Similarly, the finance committee meeting was a continuation of a meeting from last week.

Because the clock officially continues to run when a meeting is suspended, in mid-afternoon Thursday the committee reached its 180th hour of considering an opposition effort to pry WE-related documents out of the government beyond those released in redacted form in August.

Much of that time was taken up with competing points of order raised mainly by Liberal members, but also questions by Conservatives about whether the Liberals' points of order were really points of order and an attempt to challenge a ruling by Liberal committee chair Wayne Easter that the Prince Edward Island MP said couldn't be challenged because it wasn't a ruling.

Liberals Peter Fragiskatos and Julie Dzerowicz delved deeply into the redacted documents, pointing out numerous instances where the blacked-out material was civil servants' phone numbers or codes for government conference-call lines.

Trudeau's family ties to WE Charity plunged the student grant program into controversy the moment it was announced last June. WE pulled out within days and has since repaid all money advanced by the federal government to run the program.

Four committees, including the ethics and finance committees, had launched or were preparing to launch investigations into the affair when Trudeau prorogued Parliament, bringing all committee work to a halt.

Opposition parties are now trying to reopen their investigations at the finance and ethics committees, demanding documents that each committee had already asked for before prorogation. But the Conservatives, Bloc and NDP are all also proposing, in separate motions, to create a special committee that could take over the investigation. Whether we will eventually get a vaccine isn’t in question. What is in question is who will have access to it, and when?

Experts are warning that some countries are tilting toward “vaccine nationalism” — a focus on competing to take care of their own populations first rather than sufficiently cooperating with the global community, especially poorer countries, to ensure equitable access to a coronavirus vaccine. Canada, which has pre-purchased nearly 300 million doses from a handful of vaccine candidates, could be headed in that direction.

Writing in the Atlantic in August, Alan Bernstein, president and chief executive of the Canada-based global research organization CIFAR and a member of the Canadian Covid-19 Vaccine Task Force, lauded international cooperation in researching a vaccine. He wrote that he was “optimistic that the world will have a safe and effective vaccine by the end of this year or early 2021.”

That is very good news. But “the world” doesn’t necessarily mean everyone, he cautioned. “I worry that people everywhere won’t have equal access to it,” he added.

As many observers have pointed out, once a vaccine is developed, billions of doses will be needed to administer it to everyone in the world. It’s not unlikely that the vaccine will require more than one shot. That’s going to cost us. Of course, there’s no alternative. States must pay to protect public health and prepare the way toward an eventual return to something like normal, saving countries billions in the long run.

Researchers Ronald Labonte, Katrina Plamondon, Mira Johri and Srinivas Murthy, writing in the Conversation last month, echoed Bernstein’s concern. They argued that Canada is part of “the premier league of the vaccine nationalists,” a small group of countries that have bought “more than half the world’s expected short-term supply of vaccines.”

Of course, the ultimate question of whether Canada is a vaccine nationalist — or to what extent — is not whether the country purchases doses or how many, but rather how many it supplies to its own citizens, compared with those around the world who might not otherwise have timely access to a vaccine — or any access at all.

Labonte and his co-writers argued that Canada should pledge at least as much internationally through the global COVAX effort — a vaccine research and distribution alliance — as it does domestically. They’re right. The dictates of justice and equity demand that the governments of the world work together to reduce harm, save lives and end the pandemic. So does raw self-interest.

In a recent recording for my podcast “Open to Debate,” Bernstein acknowledged the humanitarian necessity of wealthy nations making doses available for poorer ones. He also pointed out that, like it or not, we are all in this together until the end. “This pandemic will not be over until everyone is vaccinated,” he said. “If the virus is anywhere, it’s everywhere.”

On balance, the nature of the pandemic implies a clear, rational and just way forward — for wealthy countries to contribute what it takes to get the entire world vaccinated as soon as possible. “I don’t view it as an either/or decision, this tension between looking after one’s own country and contributing to a multilateral initiative,” Bernstein said. “Rich countries can do both, and rich countries should do both.”

So far, Canada has committed 440 million Canadian dollars to COVAX, though half of that sum is for domestic doses. Last week, China joined the effort. The United States and Russia remain holdouts.

As part of the international push, and despite — or perhaps because of — the lack of U.S. leadership, Canada should contribute more to the global effort to procure vaccine doses for poorer countries. Not only is it in the country’s own interest to stamp out the virus worldwide, but Canada has also long been the beneficiary of colonialism and exploitation abroad, from the founding of the state itself to ongoing exploitative extractive, productive and trade practices.

Canada’s perspective should not be “one for you, one for me,” but be scaled to ensure that the country is fully part of a concerted global effort to distribute the vaccine to every nation, regardless of whether it is rich or poor, in a timely manner. This effort must therefore include not only vaccine doses, but also the means by which to distribute and administer them wherever they are needed, for as long as they are needed.

The pandemic is a global affair. Now is not the time to imagine borders as barriers to a swift and full resolution of the pandemic once a vaccine or vaccines become available. This moment is a test of Canada’s commitment to a better, more equitable world.
