U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at the Port of Buffalo seized more than a tonne of cannabis in a commercial shipment this week coming in from Canada.

This is the most recent in a string of large seizures since the border was closed to all but essential traffic in the wake of the global pandemic.

On October 15, CBP officers discovered 2,145 vacuum-sealed one pound packages of cannabis in a commercial shipment of 20 pallets during the internal inspection. It was also determined that the marijuana had an estimated street value of more than $8 million dollars, at a value of about $5 a gram.

US border authorities now say they have captured more than 40,000 pounds of cannabis coming in from Canada since last October, valued at nearly $100 million US.

Both US and Canadian authorities have intercepted numerous large cannabis shipments at or destined for the US border since the two countries closed their border to all non essential traffic in March due to the global pandemic. The bulk of seized shipments has been since the border closure in March.

“Our CBP officers remain enforcement focused and driven and this latest large load marijuana seizure is proof of that”, said Port Director Jennifer De La O. “Their efforts have produced record setting results for narcotics seizures within the Buffalo Field Office exemplifying their dedication to the CBP mission.”
