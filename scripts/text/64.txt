Dig deeper into the report and you see that nine doctors returned to Alberta, 142 are newly-licensed Alberta trainees, and 139 are new to Alberta but trained somewhere else. You can also see something more important. For those who aren’t working in Alberta anymore, four gave up their licence, five were suspended, three passed away, and 22 retired. The number who left Alberta: 13.

The third-quarter report is a snapshot in time and should be taken with a grain of salt, but taking a hard look at the information contained within and comparing it to trends seen in previous years shows no striking changes. This gives patients in Alberta a glimpse of what we know to be true, but critics ignore: hundreds of physicians come and go every year for different reasons, all of them perfectly understandable.

It’s not easy to talk about how much taxpayers should pay Alberta’s doctors. We pay our 11,000 doctors over $5 billion. That’s 10 per cent of the entire provincial budget. The right amount should take into account the province’s financial situation, generously compensate doctors, and consider regional differences.

I believe we’ve made every effort to do exactly that. For example, this spring we brought in the most comprehensive plan in Canada for recruiting and retaining doctors in our rural communities: increasing how much we pay rural doctors, purchasing dedicated spots in medical schools for students willing to commit to working in rural Alberta, and a raft of other changes.
